4408,Does increase milk supply,"This really helped to increase my milk supply.  The taste wasn't so great for me, kind of a black licorice flavor but you get used to it. Also, it changes your body odor (might sound strange), but it makes it sweet smelling---kind of like maple syrup. One thing I did not like though was that it increased my appetite.  I mean DRASTICALLY increased my appetite.  I believe fenugreek was the culprit for the appetite increase, and I am positive it was for the body odor change.  Anyway, I used this tea for about 8 months, worked pretty well for its main purpose of milk production.",3.0
4209,One bad packet ruins the product!,"I should have stayed with Idahoan brand. Poor Betty is on her last legs, rolling downhill into oblivion!I've used several brands of potato flakes and found them very good. But not Betty's brand. The finished product tastes stale. Bland, unpleasant, not worth continuing eating---but the worst part is STALE.  I am totally ashamed of Amazon for offrering these packets. My advice to any customer looking for good mashed potato flakes: Move on to Idahoan or another brand and leave poor Betty by the wayside.Where these packets should have been left. Alone. Ignored. Skipped over. By the way, I didn't like them!",1.0
8623,CAULIFLOWER PASTA!?,"As the pasta cooked, I read the box to see what makes this ""smmmile, it'sveggie pasta & cheese.""  Cauliflower pasta? I'd never heard of such a thing. What a good idea!  (The dinner, on the whole, has two grams fewer of carbohydrates, at 47g carbohydrate, 7g sugar. I was hoping that this would be a good alternative for a diabetic friend, but it won't be.)My only deviation from the recipe on the box was using 1% milk.  I didn't doctor it with extra ingredients or by adding vegetables, because I wanted to taste what it tasted like on its own.It tasted like Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, the stuff that my mom occasionally fed us when we were kids.  The pasta was soft but not mushy. The cheese concoction tastes the same as the standard.Not as good as my friend Meem's homemade - it's not even the same category - but DEFINITELY better than adequate as a comfort food from one's childhood.The other member of my household agreed on all points, including, since ""sneaking"" vegetables in our household was never an issue, that this would taste even yummier with fresh broccoli or cauliflower in it.More Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, please?",4.0
9439,Tasty and inexpensive,"I really like this cereal. The flavor is slightly nutty and it doesn't get soggy quickly in almond milk. It reminds me of Honey Smacks without any sugar. My favorite way to eat it is with some chopped raw almonds, flax seeds and a touch of agave nectar.",5.0
7110,I'm Confused,"The label on the bowl says 35 grams is in the bowl and that it is 110 calories, but when I weighed it myself on my food scale it weighed almost twice that! I'm confused, does the whole bowl really contain 110 calories? I really want to know can someone help?",2.0

5944,Return of Zico tetra pak,"I have been an avid coconut water drinker for the past year and a half and I have tried almost all the brands available:  ONE, VitaCoco, Amy and Bryan, Nature Factor, original Zico, and re-release Zico Tetra Pak, and Naked coconut water.I would like to say the original Zico was the best tasting of all of them however they changed to the plastic bottles earlier this year which received a large number of negative reviews from people who loved the original Zico thus I avoided but now have brought back the Tetra pak.This version they brought back unfortunately does not taste like the original Zico.  Some of you might think that since it's been sometime, perhaps you don't remember what the original taste like.  Well, I would say that I have purchase 12 cartons of their original Tetra pak and drink 1 or 2 a day so I definitely remember what the original taste like.  The flavor is a bit more tart and now tastes closer to VitaCoco which is the most tart of all the brands something that I just do not like.I would purchase in the following order:1.  ONE - Amazon still is out of stock and hoping they come back in stock, this is best tasting one since the original Zico is no longer made.2.  Naked Juice - I like the subtle taste and though does not have quite the coconut flavor as ONE, it doesn't taste tart which is what I don't like.3.  Zico - It just tastes more tart4.  VitaCoco - Not a fan of tart coconut water5  Amy and Bryan and Nature Factor taste way too sweet for me.Zico had the best tasting coconut and that was a consensus if you look at earlier reviews.  I would have continued to purchase their product indefinitely even though they tend to cost a bit more than the other brands but they destroyed any good will they had by stopping production of the original Zico tetra pak and  thinking consumers like us would settle for that concentrate stuff, shame on them.",3.0

2013,Misleading...,"UPDATE INFO AS OF 1/29/2014List Price: $20.94Price: $4.91 ($0.02 / oz)You Save: $16.03 (77%)$0.02 an oz for 16oz in a pound will be only $0.32 a bag not $4.91 as claimed by the seller. Flax seeds sells never sells for $20.94 a bag as claimed by the seller. It seems that the seller keeps changing the sale numbers in order to sell a product. Arrowhead is an excellent brand with many great organic products where others fail to produce in organic form but this approach is just misleading and not necessary at all.*****************************************************************************************************************************ORIGINAL REVIEW 10/11/2013Seller claims;List Price: $40.61Price: $8.24 ($0.04/oz) & FREE Shipping on orders over $25You Save: $32.37 (80%)That is misleading. No flax sells for $40 a pound. At $8.24 a pound it is 824/16=51.5 infact something like more than $0.51 cents an oz not $0.04 an oz. Arrowhead is a good brand but the seller is misrepresenting the facts.*****************************************************************************************************************************MISLEADING LABELING: sprinkle a tablespoon of ground seeds... 14oz not 16 oz since it is golden not brown.It is shame that Arrowhead with so many fine organic products will misguide consumers just to sell a product. In the beginning there was only one color flax which was brown but now there is golden as well. Usually in organic form except in supplement form, the farmer co-up flax or any type of seeds are always more expensive due to their practices which is not sold on Amazon at all. Brown and golden have the same nutritional value so I never consume one, I mix brown and golden regardless. In some cases Golden is more expensive than brown. If not specified on the labeling the type of flax, then it means brown flax not golden flax.OILS: I started consuming flax oil years ago per my physician's advise not knowing that majority forms of flaxseeds are rancid and absolutely worthless due to oil in seeds. As whole, human body cannot digest any seed that size with that consistency regardless if it is flax, sesame, amaranth, chia, millet, etc. unless cooked or in ground form since human body cannot digest in its natural form. As SUPPLEMENT, TABLET FORM, OIL, POWDER, GROUND IN BAGS are all worthless and hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. Rancid is a process of Mother Nature and has nothing to do with organic, conventional, GMO or the type of seed. Advising consumers to purchase different brands of flax in oil form or powder or tablet form are all marketing tools as well. It is not important even if the oil or the tablet or the powder in bags are even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the type or brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed and air will get to the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if you keep the rice in a sealed container, wrapped in the most elaborate sealing containers in the world regardless. Chia is the only seed that claims it does not need to be ground but that is a marketing tool just like the price of chia is since it comes from outside US and individuals without any knowledge about nutrition always associate those as superior for exotic reasons and pay a hefty price for a food item with less nutrients. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed. After many years of consuming seeds, I chose to ground all seeds myself and seal immediately, kept in freezer and consumed within few days which I am very happy with the results since after all looking fit and well is just result of training hard and living a healthy lifestyle which surrounds any professional athlete or a happy individual involved in many sport activities regardless.OMEGA 3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA and it is the same for any brand of flax seed regardless if such flax seed oil is in solid oil form in a bottle or a capsule form. Greens, nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables do not offer any omega-3 since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. Flaxseeds offer more ALA than chia, 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseeds are important part of my diet since flax offers so many different nutrients.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is the king of nutrients when it comes to minerals so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, highest magnesium, highest potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEWCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional.FAT: The most important hormone, and the one that's crucial for weight loss, is insulin. Insulin is the hormone that controls fat storage. A high-carb diet increases the amount of glucose in the bloodstream, which in turn means you produce more insulin. The more insulin the body produces, the more fat gets stored. A low-carb diet means less insulin, making it easier to lose weight because less fat is then stored. For intake of a massive 5,000 calories every day for three weeks with calories from a low-fat, high-carb diet; and for another three weeks with calories from more fat no carbs with exactly the same amount of calories, with moderate exercise regimen each time; low-fat diet stacked on 16&#8201;lb with 3.7"" (9.5&#8201;cm) around the middle where the high fat diet offered a loss of 2.5 lb and loss of 1""(2.5&#8201;cm) from waistline. If calorie is calorie, then in my case and my experience shows that I would prefer to get my calories from a healthy fat from sesame seed and almond than the calories from the carbs in chia. Almonds have the highest fat calories from all the seeds and nuts, a priority to me in type of calories since I am kind of vegan who consumes fish but hardly any meat, chicken, pork or dairy.Accordingly for 28gr/1oz servings size of;Amaranth__quinoa__flax__peanut__almonds__chia__sesame__sunflower__cashew__pistachioTOTAL CALORIES28.6__33.6__ 150__166__161__137__160__162__155__156CALORIES FROM CARBS21.2__23.6__33__28.9__24.6__50__26.8__31.2__34.4__31.8CALORIES FROM FAT3.7__4.8__98.8__121__116__72.1__116__112__103__104CALORIES FROM PROTEIN3.7__4.9__17.8__16.8__20.6__15.2__17.2__19.1__17.7__20For almost the same total calories sesame offers half of chia's ""CARB CALORIES"" gain but 50% more ""FAT CALORIES"" with high amount of nutrients for weight loss. Sesame, flax and hemp are my superfood but almonds are the superfood when it comes to vitamin E. Americans consume enough peanut butter each year to coat the floor of the Grand Canyon, priced for 1/3 but hardly with any nutrients except B-complex. No wonder Burma is the highest producer of sesame in the world. But none of those kings offer ALA and not only flax's high ALA is needed but it balances the omega-6 which is so worthless and abandoned in all foods that not healthy at all. Flax only in powder form, ground freshly.",1.0

So I decided to give the Mushroom Rice Sides and the Asian Chicken Fried Rice Sides a try.  What a huge disappointment!  Not only are they sticky and gummy texture-wise, they are virtually tasteless.  Could not detect any mushroom flavor at all.

I followed up with another tentative taste to confirm it really was so horrible and then I asked my wife to try it and see what the flavor was. She took a small taste, grimaced and said, &#34;Robitussin.&#34;On the positive side, I drank it on Easter morning so I would stay awake during the sunrise service and then drive for an hour to go to a family get-together and it did keep me awake.",1.0
8734,Should Be Renamed Yucky Mac!,"I am a long time lover of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese (the blue box please). I have tried many different brands of microwavable macaroni and cheese and most are barely edible. The Kraft Easy Mac falls into the barely edible category, just barely!You receive 18 pouches with this product. THESE ARE NOT the Easy Mac bowls like you see in the stores. These are packets that you have to open, pour into a bowl, and measure and add your own liquid to. Like all Kraft Easy Mac, the best thing about this product is that it's quick and easy to prepare, in fact, that's the only thing I like about this product.The taste is NOTHING like Kraft Macaroni and Cheese in the blue box. This has a powdery, blah taste to it. The cheese is not strong enough to taste cheesy, but too strong to taste plain, so it has sort of a milk that thickened consistency and taste and is just disgusting. The noodles have that slimy, clumpy appearance that many microwavable noodle products suffer from. It's not the worst microwavable macaroni and cheese I've ever eaten, but it's certainly not something I will buy again in the future.",2.0

6279,Annie's Homegrown Organic Whole Wheat Shells & White Cheddar Macaroni & Cheese - 6 oz.,"This product is made by Annie's Inc. in Berkely, CA--made in the USA.  The product maintains excellent organic integrity, and it is stored in 100% recycled paperboard packaging.The manufacturers also support family farms - use organic milk, butter, and yogurt.  The product takes approximately 10 min. to prepare.  The product contains dairy and wheat, and it has been exposed to equipment that also processes egg and soy products.The ingredients include organic whole wheat shell pasta, organic valley organic cheddar cheese (organic cultured pasteurized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), organic whey, salt, and sodium phosphate.This is a mildly flavored whole wheat macaroni & cheese dinner.  This mac and cheese is a wonderful comfort food.  The pasta is firm, and it has an excellent flavor.There are no artificial flavors, synthetics colors, or preservatives.  The pasta was produced without antibiotics, synthetic hormones, or persistent pesticides.This pasta is simple to make and it has a wonderful texture.  There are 2.5 servings per box (2.5 oz).  Each serving contains 250 cal., 4.5 g fat, sat. 2 g fat, 10 mg cholest., 570 mg sodium, 43 g carb., 5 g fiber, 6 g sugars, 9 g protein.However, the cheese envelop is not exactly sufficient even when you add the butter, milk, or yogurt.  To add that wonderful rich smooth cheese flavor that accompanies mac and cheese, you will have to add your own organic cheese.The cheese packet falls flat on flavor and it does not contain a sufficient amount to coat the pasta.  I give this mac and cheese a 5/5 on packaging, 5/5 for maintain organic integrity, 5/5 on texture, and a 2/5 for flavor.",3.0

I would describe the chocolate flavor as ""robust,"" rather than ""delicious."" A friend tasting with me thought she detected a chalky aftertaste but I did not notice it. The sweetening agent is maltitol, an alcohol sugar (sorbitol is another popular one) which causes some individuals, myself included, stomach distress and/or diarrhea.  On the plus side, the bar is gluten free, has 20 grams of protein and clocks in at a modest 240 calories. I would say if you are gluten challenged and can tolerate the maltitol (some can) this would be satisfactory as a snack bar.On the other hand, if you find yourself racing for the bathroom, you might want to rethink your relationship with maltitol.",3.0

6954,Definitely Not For Me or My Spouse,"I was under the impression I was getting a box of 15 bars at least there was nothing otherwise that would indicate something less. I received one bar on a hot Saturday afternoon delivered by the Post office. The bar was soft and we had to refrigerate it for several minutes before we could taste it. The first taste was enough to appreciate the fact we only received one bar of the Think This Chocolate Fudge Bar. There is a slightly bitter taste plus there is a lingering dryness that will take a while to disappear. While the bar touts only 20g of protein and zero sugar, I think we will opt for a High Protein Bar that has more flavor and less of the after lingering effects. I just ate a Hershey bar and now the original taste is gone. By doing so I messed up terribly the sugar and protein count for today.The bar states that the mission of thinkThin is to positivity impact the lives and wellness of others and to lead in changing the endemic destruction of weight and poor nutrition related diseases in our country. I am afraid the maker has gotten somewhat carried away in his/her ambitious mission statement. I may never buy a protein bar again. Sorry! I do agree that you would probably lose weight since after the first bite I wanted nothing else to eat.By the way the bar does not hold up to the very hot heat outside here in Texas however In have to fault the Post office for part of this since the delivery was made in the late afternoon thus that little bar has been on that truck all day.",1.0
2106,Put  Wicks in Them,"I recently ordered some of Meiji's limited-edition chocolate bars online and it occurred to me that perhaps Amazon carried them for less (they don't, at all). My quest led me to this product which not only looked interesting but had garnered reviewer raves as well. Today's errands took me past a Japanese grocery, so I made it a point to have a look for it (it's apparently a popular impulse purchase because it was displayed next to the cash register).Given the positive reviews, I had high hopes. And if appearance is high on your list of priorities, then this is definitely your kind of snack because one thing the Japanese have nailed, in spades, is a visual aesthetic and these things are adorable, plus mine came packaged in a really snappy cardboard tube. However, while good looks are the top priority when it comes to boyfriends, my criteria for food are much less shallow and Apollo falls short of the mark.I think the basis of the problem is that the Japanese, who produce a number of slammin' items (remember that aesthetic), have so far proved themselves incapable of mastering chocolate. I have yet to sample Japanese chocolate that isn't both waxy and short on the essence of chocolate flavor. This item is no exception, plus I don't find the strawberry flavor all that vivid (although to Meiji's credit, it's natural). And it really is easy to finish the container, but I believe that's due more to the fact that Apollo is sweet and innocuous, not that it's delicious. Perhaps if cocoa butter rather than vegetable oil had been the second ingredient listed, Apollo would suggest chocolate rather than paraffin, but who can say for sure? What is sure is that I won't be buying it again.The bottom line: empty calories can be had more deliciously; save your quota for a more worthy goodie. I have no doubt that this review will earn me slams from fan boys (in addition to those guaranteed to turn up immediately, courtesy of obsessive liver-lipped Finnish ugly-boy troll stalkers), but I have to call 'em as I see 'em. 3.5 stars would be about right, but we can't assign by halves so 3 it is.",3.0

3895,A great canned soup,"This is one of my favorite lunch staples, and something that I try to keep stocked in my food pantry at all times. (I also love the steak and noodles variety.) It's much, much better than the original version of Cambell's chicken noodle soup,  and and for the price makes for a tasty, low-cal, and filling lunch (or even dinner). I'll doctor it up sometime by adding a little lemon juice, fat-free sour cream, or mozzarella or parmesan cheese. Add a few crackers, and it's a substantial meal. I am particularly happy that this is available through Amazon Prime, since I live on a bridge-less island and have to haul my groceries over on a ferry.

Add a healthy dose of cracked pepper after cooking and it really is tasty.It cooks fast, is very simple to prepare and you have a good sized SIDE dish for TWO - or a MEAL FOR ONE - or a small helping for FOUR.My three star rating may be a bit generous for a processed food.

8653,Disappointing Taste and Nutrition,"You look at the box and you think -- a way to sneak in more veggies that no one will notice. As good as that might sound, you have to look deeper at this box and the product inside.I prepared this for my family and I was immediately confused by the nutritional list on the box.  Now a non-veggie pasta from Kraft Mac & Cheese has three servings, this listed only two but to be blunt it easily fed three people.  It also listed only one half serving of vegetables per serving in the box so frankly with one box feeding three of us, it was basically adding no vegetable value at all.The taste was basically tasteless. We expect a certain cheesiness from Kraft and this just failed utterly.  It was salty but not cheesy.  The only creaminess was from the milk and butter I added along with some spice when it proved so bland.I could take a nice tomato and/or spinach pasta and add my own cheese mix to get a product that was tastier and healthier.  My family would eat it and be better pleased as well.  No one liked it in my household.",2.0
6711,Not impressed by this tea,"I am a chocolate fanatic and pairing chocolate with tea only seems natural to me.  I've sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea, when compared to the others, is nothing spectacular.  When unbrewed, the Stash tea bag smells like chocolate but that scent does not translate to much of a chocolate flavor once the tea is brewed.  I could taste quite a bit of vanilla and some nut but the chocolate was just negligible. Additionally, there was a strange aftertaste with this tea.  It just wasn't pleasant.If you are committed to a chocolate decaffeinated beverage, your choices will be limited. I have sampled quite a few chocolate teas and many use a black tea base.  However, if interested in a caffeine free tee that has a good body, I would recommendChocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea, which is a naturally caffeine free tea.  Zhena's chocolate chai is supposed to taste like chocolate, but it has a lot of spices.  Still,Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Teahas a much richer overall flavor than the Stash Premium Chocolate Hazelnut tea.If you don't care about caffeine and are just looking for a chocolate tea, there are several others that I would recommend before this one.  They include:Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea,SerendipiTea ChocolaTea, Chocolate, Vanilla, Rooibos & Black Tea, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2), andBigelow White Chocolate ObsessionTea, 1.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6).  The first two are loose teas and the last is a bagged tea.At the end of the day, I don't think I would recommend this Stash tea to any chocolate lover.  It doesn't taste like chocolate and the overall flavor is poor.",2.0

9671,Very Good - True Fruit Taste,"Never been a lover of herbal teas, but middle age has brought on bouts of insomnia :( very sad - anyway - I finally figured out that my great love of tea has been keeping me awake at night and have actually been ""craving"" herbal teas.  I tried and disliked them intensely when they were popular in the 90's, but took another try at it again a few days ago.My biggest problem with them was how any fruit tea tasted so ""herby"" to me.  But not anymore.  These teas, and I've tried them but the peach, taste like real fruit.  There is an herbal taste, but it's mellowed, rounded and in the background.  I actually like them a lot.  I am sitting here with the black cherry steaming in a cup and, again, save the slightest herbal taste, it reminds me a life saver cherry candy.  I actually taste a definite ""tartness"" in the after taste, which I love.So I'm sold.  The blueberry and raspberry were outstanding and very true to their namesake - and they smell good.  Tried both last night and realized that my kitchen smelled like ""fruit juice"" when I woke up this morning.  I was delighted by that. :)",5.0
3046,Bags Arrived Leaking -  Third Shipment Much Better,"UPDATE:  I decided to give this company one more try and placed a third order forthree 10 LB bags of Domino granulated sugar.  This time the bags arrived without any damage. I also noticed that the sugar is now sent in heavy plastic bags instead of the paper bags which are so easily damaged in shipment.This sugar is not inexpensive, however, when you consider that these bags are heavy (especially if you are purchasing more than one) and that shipping is free, they are a pretty good deal. Particularly if you are purchasing several bags at once.So I have moved the rating from one star to three..Earlier...I received my order of  4, ten LB bags of Domino's granulated sugar in two separate shipments.  I have no idea why they could not have been shipped at once.  The first 10 LB bag showed up fine.  However, the second three showed upin external bags, because each of the Domino's bags was leaking. One of the three bags was not even in the second bag it had been placed in because it had been leaking, and half of the sugar leaked out into the main shipping box, and  all over the  other items which had been shipped in this box.This was the second order that I had placed with this company in less than a week, because UPS reported that the original order had been damaged in shipment and had to be returned to the seller.Hopefully, you'll have better luck than I did with them.  However, I won't purchase from this merchant again.",3.0

Packaging is bad - noodles are not sealed, they're just plain in the box, coated in seasoning and all.  Any bug can get into this box and feast on tasty noodles.  I can't imagine why they made the choice not to put them at least in a sealed plastic bag inside the package. Plain noodles are ok, they're completely dry, but this product was seasoned.  For this reason I'd never buy them again.  Bugs took good 2 months to get rid of, extremely annoying in a completely bug-free home.  Now I understand why all seasoned noodles come in plastic packaging.  I had to throw out all remaining noodles.",1.0
5376,"Some corn syrup solids, i.e. fructose linked to addiction & liver damage","Enfamil EnfaCare Infant (ages 0-12 months) is characterized by milk, whey proteins, more corn syrup, less lactose, DHA, choline, vitamins, and minerals.The sugar in milk is non-sweet lactose (disaccharide), which is not absorbed into the bloodstream already in the mouth, as sweet glucose (monosaccharide), which thus is not a healthy substitute for lactose. Unfortunately, most of milk's lactose is substituted for corn (glucose) syrup solids in EnfaCare and not for a polysaccharide, e.g. maltodextrin.  Corn syrup (solids) contains glucose and - like high fructose corn syrup - may contain fructose, which presence (sweetness) can be masked by adding other sugars. Scientists say high fructose corn syrup is addictive as cocaine. So are corn syrup solids with fructose, which content is not provided on the label. Also, high intake of dietary fructose may lead to liver damage from bacteria due to their movement from gut into the blood stream and liver.So, would you like to start your child's obesity and exposure to a potential liver disease (NAFLD) when he/she is an infant, wait for later, or maybe not to accustom the child to corn syrup at all in order to avoid the fructose desire/addiction, as concentrated fructose is not common in nature, humans were not exposed to its consumption, and thus are vulnerable even those who are not obese yet?! A benefit for prematurity does not excuse beginning addition.DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) found in fish oil is an omega-3 fatty acid that can be synthesized in humans. A study found that preterm infants fed DHA had better developmental outcomes, but not the full-term infants or term infants (1-12 mo) who develop normally.  A formula for the newborn (0-3 mo) without corn syrup seems to suit better both the preterm and full-term newborns while no evidence suggests that supplementing DHA for the older infants (3-12 mo) is beneficial.Choline is found in sunflower, soy, cod fish, broccoli, cauliflower, milk, chicken, etc. Endurance athletes and people who drink a lot of alcohol may be at risk for choline deficiency and may benefit from choline supplements.Mead Johnson (& Co) Nutrition has 3 lines of formulas: Enfamil Newborn (ages up to 3 months), Enfamil Infant (up to 12 months), and Enfagrow Toddler Transitions (9 to 18 months) and Enfagrow Toddler Next Step Milk Drinks (1 year & up). Except Enfamil Newborn, Infant A.R. and partially EnfaCare, all milk's lactose is substituted for corn (glucose) syrup solids in Mead Johnson (& Co) Nutrition formulas including the Infant Soy. Enfamil Newborn is characterized by easy to digest proteins, choline, DHA, and vitamin D. Enfagrow Toddler Transitions is characterized by DHA, choline, calcium, vitamin D, and antioxidants. Enfagrow Toddler Next Step is characterized by calcium and vitamin D, and is available in two flavors: vanilla and natural milk.",3.0
1435,surprisingly... good,"Okay... so I am new to Senseo and ALL of its varieties of coffees. The machine came with a sample of Dark Roast. It's not that the roast itself was bad, it just tasted ""flat"" - none of the overtones of the nectar of the gods - and I was sorely disappointed. However, I was on a mission to make 1 cup at a time, having reviewed all the other 1 cup machines out there I was sure that Senseo was not just the best deal, but the best machine - and then... when all hope seemed lost... a light at the end of the tunnel was seen and at its core was Medium Roast. This stuff is good coffee people! You can taste the nuances and hints of floral, chocolately, nutty, and all those other words that go with describing good coffee... so I highly recommend these pods. They taste wonderful and will have you returning to the Senseo for another cup before work begins... FIVE STARS!!!",5.0

4197,Major Ostrim Fan gets Major Food Poisoning - Timeline of Events,"As someone who has been a fan of Ostrim products for the past five years, I have probably eaten 300-400 of these high protein snacks without incident.  Unfortunately, this was not the case with my purchase in February of 2011. In an attempt to shave costs off of my high protein diet that can over 1,000 dollars per month for one person, I decided to purchase 60 Ostrim sticks (3 x 20) in regular, barbecue and teriyaki flavors. Since the expiration dates of these are generally a year into the future, I assumed that I could store the sticks for several weeks.  I was dead wrong.After about four weeks of storing the sticks at room temperature, several of the shrink-wrapped air-tight sticks started inflating like balloons. This is a sign CO2 and methane being generated during decomposition. The inflated sticks were discarded and the few remaining that were still in their normal shrink-wrapped state were placed in a refrigerator.About a week later, I ate three refrigerated sticks just before heading to a venue for which I purchased tickets.  This enabled me to get an exact timeline of the events, which are chronicled below.  Suffice it to say, about four hours after eating three of the refrigerated sticks, I became deathly ill.  I am 99% certain the Ostrim sticks were the source of the food poisoning due to the highly controlled, high protein diet at the time where every food, calorie, and gram of protein was being monitored.The symptoms were so severe, I thought about going to the hospital. My girlfriend at the time was a physician who was able to provide some assurance that the issue was not life threatening. It took about three days to recover, which meant three days of zero productivity. In the end, a regular Ostrim consumer became someone who cringes at the very sight of the Ostrim display at my health club.Timeline of Ostrim Food PoisoningEvent..........Date..........TimeOrder from Amazon..........2/11/2011Package Arrived ..........2/16/2011Discard of inflated (decomposed) ..........

Macelignan the compound in nutmeg fights the germs which reduces plaque formation by 50 percent and eradicates cavity-producing microbes. This is not saffron. Saffron is very, very expensive and comes from Iran. Nutmeg is from Malaysia and Indonesia. For purity place some in water. If water turns into a murky color then it is diluted since real nutmeg will turn water yellow. In small quantities nutmeg is safe, but in higher quantities, nutmeg is very poisonous and toxic. Nutmeg has been used as a drug in other countries and indulgence can cause a slew of adverse effects. I use it in moderation and try to get the whole nut and grind it myself. In my big dishes, I just throw in the nut, no grinding. Nutmeg has a very strong and distinctive taste.Spice Hunter is sold everywhere so prices varies considerably. This is a good brand in organic form. Powders always lose the taste and smell sooner than the whole nut regardless of the food item but grinding may be a challenge for such a hard nut.",5.0

I thought it was a fluke the first time, so I wiped everything up and put it back in. It 'popped' and fell over three more times.Given the fact that the purpose of buying these containers is for convenience, I don't think it's very convenient to have to bring an extra bowl to work to pour the soup into before heating it up.That said, the price and the taste is what prompted me to buy another package.

The addition of sorghum flour lends a honey-whole wheat taste and a nice structure to the finished product. I have made beautiful baked goods with this (all by hand, no stand mixer) including cinnamon buns, yummy chewy pizza crust, pie crust, French bread, pretzels, and the BEST gluten free bagels I have ever had. It's also vegan. So those with dairy or egg intolerance can play with it too! Amazon's Subscribe and Save program makes this an affordable option that I can share with my whole family. It's not just called, Mom's bread, now.",5.0

But once I took a couple of sips, the warmth of the ginger, and the sweet taste of honey, all combined and cleared my sinuses, soothed my sore throat, and made me feel really relaxed. Now, it just smells like ginger and honey to me, and I know it will make me feel better.I also drink it when I have an upset stomach. The ginger makes you feel like all your stomach muscles relax and it warms you up from the inside. It settles queasiness too.But don't just think of this as a medicinal drink. It's tasty, and is a great addition to my collection of tea. Even when I'm not feeling a cold or a stomach ache, it's a great way to warm up and relax!",5.0

It started as soon as he was born, and it has improved greatly as he's got older. We went to formula full time when his stomach seemed to reject my breastmilk, and he was losing a lot of weight.He's did pretty well on some of the formulas he's used. Gentlease was great, except for the fact that it cause SEVERE constipation. He did well with the regular Toddler Transitions formula, so we will keep it in mind if milk doesn't agree with him in a couple of months. He's did the best with the AR formula. We LOVE it!All of that to say that this formula caused my little one to start spitting up very soon after using it. It's definitely worth a try for babies with colic! For spitting up?

I thought this would be a good replacement, but alas, I will have to go searching and see if I can find a farmer's market nearby.If you're coming from the perspective of using the honey flavoured corn syrup often sold as honey in supermarkets, you'll find this delightful.

9779,Beautiful rosy-red orange tea,"The original Red Zinger formula had about twenty herbs and made a red, sour-sweet minty tea that was original and popular. The formula was revised maybe 20 years ago to a simpler hibiscus-rose hip mix and still makes a nice, red tea. Various fruit essences were added, such as raspberry, mountain berries and now tangerine orange. This is somewhat different than Mandarin Spice (no cinnamon or clove) and it's very like Red Zinger with a slight tangerine overtone. It's delicious hot, but if you like juices or your kids love juice, you can make up this tea to a rather strong brew, chill it, and mix it fifty-fifty with your juice of choice (apple, cranberry, grape for example. I don't think orange would be that good, but it might, who knows?)The idea is to cut the sugar of juices down and still have a refreshing cold beverage. Drinking this mixed with juice will cut your sugar intake and your juice bill. And it's a healthy tea.We drink it all winter long, keeping a hot water pot going and making big mugs of tea to stay hydrated and it even keeps you warm. Sipping hot, sugar-free tea keeps you from eating junk, satisfies your sweet tooth and keeps you away from artificial sweeteners, caffeine and other less-healthy beverages.",5.0

The cost is a little high but I don't think you could do any better price-wise at home buying all the different kinds of chocolates used.  The best way to describe the flavor is  deep cocoa .  It's rich and dark, like hot chocolate.  It tastes nothing at all like a milkshake although it's is cold.  The canister is a nice improvement over the pouches, you get to customize the flavor a little easier.  Because of the cost, it's a once in a while treat for us and it is a favorite.

8488,Mediocre Marketing Gimmick,"I'm not a believer in ""sneaking vegetables past the children,"" especially when the veg in question is in the form of pasta. While there may technically be cauliflower in it, it has none of the health benefits of eating actual cauliflower. There is also less in a package than original mac and cheese, and only two servings rather than three. Even if the cost per package is the same, that makes this product more expensive per serving.Cooking the very thin pasta for the six minutes directed on the package resulted in pasta well past the al dente stage. I used butter rather than margarine in the preparation but otherwise made as directed with no added ingredients. We got two decent sized servings from the box. The resulting mixture was just o.k. For me, the pasta had no texture and little taste, only a mild cheese flavor. Mrs. Boilermate said she could taste the veg in the pasta and said she thought it was a ""good addition."" She thought it was less creamy than ""Easy Mac"" or the regular variety. She said Stouffers Mac and Cheese was better, and I agree with her.Overall there's not enough here for me to like enough to purchase this product. You get less per package than the regular variety in exchange for a ""veggie benefit"" that's a bit over-hyped. And, if Mrs. B. is to believed, one that doesn't taste as good.",2.0

I am delighted to find this popcorn and I tested it by cooking it in 2 tablespoons of organic coconut oil in a stainless steel Great Northern popcorn popper that has a crank to keep the kernels moving in the popper.  They all popped completely, and perfectly with this organic brand.I also taste tested a store bought version of yellow popcorn for comparison.  As far as popping completely, this brand won. The store version had about 9 to 12 unpopped kernels left behind using the same method. There were also approximately 15 partially popped kernels left over with the store brand.  There were none with this organic brand. The size of the popcorn were both equal, but the hulls were more noticeable with this brand, yet they didn't seem to get caught in the teeth any more or less than the other.  Flavor was good, but not as flavorful as the store brand with nothing added to it. The texture was different from the store bought version as well.  It was less ""light"" and a bit more chewy in texture.  Nothing that would be noticeable at all for those who like the caramel version, or if you like to add salt and butter on your popcorn.I will be purchasing more of this brand.  I was somewhat concerned about the packaging, but relieved to find that it comes with its' own ziplock sealer, so no need to store it in something else to keep it fresh.

6692,Has an artificial chocolate smell and taste,"First I wish Amazon would separate the reviews for Stash teas based on flavors rather than lumping them all together.  I have the Stash Chocolate Mint Oolong tea and I really like that, so I figured I would also try this so I could have a decaf chocolate tea as well.  I ended up giving the rest of this away because the artificial smell and taste got to me. Normally I love hazelnut and figured chocolate hazelnut would be even better.  I suggest when you read the reviews on here that you check to see which flavor tea is being reviewed so that you aren't mislead.",1.0

8571,BLAND,"I am generally a fan of mac and cheese, though I typically go for the sharp cheddar variety.  I don't have a big problem eating my veggies, but if I can get a little extra in while enjoying some mac and cheese I figured it might be worth it.  Oh my goodness, but this was the most bland dish I have tasted in quite some time!  The noodles seemed a little more soft than those to which I am accustomed, and there was just no real taste at all to the sauce.  After a couple of bites, I spent some quality time in front of my spice rack and finally came away with something I was willing to eat.So if you are on a soft, bland diet and you need to get in more veggies then I guess I could recommend this.  But if you are able just stick with your usual mac and cheese and add a salad.  You will get more veggies and your taste buds will thank you.",2.0

7146,GOOD CHOICE FOR A COFFEE BREAK  ----------  BUT NOT BREAKFAST,"IN A NUTSHELL: A SUGARY-FAT GRAHAM CRACKER-LIKE SOMETHING OR OTHERThis is a reasonably palatable snack food in a package which can translate into a coffee-break on-the-go, but 'Kellogg's Cinnamania Bite Size Cinnamon Bun' is NOT a BREAKFAST.IF IT'S NOT A BREAKFAST -- THEN WHAT IS THIS STUFF?Simply stated, this is a 50 gram package of artificially flavored, hard-textured sugar crackers in a mylar package with a colorful and appetizing illustration of what is supposed to be in the package. Since 'enriched flour' is the primary ingredient it does contain a small sprinkling of a few vitamins and it has a little added calcium carbonate for calcium too.BOTTOM LINE: SEALED IN MYLAR THIS STUFF CAN LAST A LONG TIME![notice I didn't say STAY FRESH]If you can tolerate the excess of sugar, salt and fat in this product and like the taste too, then this may be an acceptible choice for an on-the-go snack in a pinch.[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]",3.0

1621,"This tastes like CINNAMON OIL, not a traditional chai blend","Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.Very, very disappointed.",1.0
4006,"Missing the Peanuts, flavor used to be better.","Anyone remember the older cheddar Chex Mix? It had peanuts, corn chex, wheat chex, round pretzels, and window pretzels. I didn't particularly care for the peanuts, but as a whole, that flavor was really cheesy and good! I remember that it leaves lots of orange cheese powder on your finger.Now, the grocery stores around only carry this newer Cheddar flavor, which has corn chex, wheat chex, twist pretzels, round pretzels, and a cheesy triangle. But I don't think the flavor tastes as good as the old one. Anyone still see the old one in regonal grocery stores? What do you all think about the old vs. new Chex Mix cheddar?They are still good, it is just not the same.  They just don't make bears like they used to.  The crackers are just too sweet.",3.0
6971,No Real Flavor...Expensive,"These Thin bars are unfortunately pretty much what you would expect from something like this.  Small, flavorless for the most part, or at least carrying an off flavor, and only satisfying in the sense that you know its better for you than a Twinkie.  I really didn't get any real chocolate fudge flavor out of these at all.  They really don't taste bad, just not satisfying or all that pleasant.  They do the trick as far as having something in your tummy and putting off hunger pangs for a little while, but that's about it.  One thing I did like about them is the chewy texture.  It was rather gummy to me in that sense which is something you either like in these things or not. I do for it gives you the sense of this small bar lasting a little longer...My biggest gripe with these is the cost.  None of these protein/diet type bars are cheap, but these are definitely on the high end for sure. And there is no flavor there to account for the bigger bucks. You can do better here as far as taste, and price.  The specs on these are pretty good for those that are really trying to lose weight or snack healthier, but I see no reason to recommend them otherwise...",2.0

The flavor is chocolate fudge and while there is an element of chocolate it is mired with a bitter aftertaste that is prelude by powdery chalk aspect that haunts my palate.  This protein bar is designed to be a meal replacement, hence the calorie count of 240 and a total fat count of 8 grams.  I would imagine that if a person is willing to sacrifice the calories and fat, this meal replacement bar should taste better.  In addition, this protein bar has cholesterol in it, which I found quite disappointing.  There is no sugar or trans fat in this bar but cholesterol?  I believe I will continue using homemade smoothies as my meal replacement.",2.0

Yuck! It tastes like really sugary old coconuts. I then looked at the ingredients and see ""premium coconut water from concentrate, natural flavors.""I just don't get it: Why would they go from using fresh coconut water in their box version to concentrated coconut water in this not very environmental friendly plastic bottle--and charge more for it!? Am I missing something?The taste is horrible and I really wish they would go back to their original formulation. There are enough pure coconut water products like vita coco, one, on the market, so why settle for something from concentrate, pay more for it, and hurt the planet with more plastic?",1.0
337,Coffee and Famously Fabulous Fritters,"On a sultry July morning, a few years before Katrina blew into town, a friend and I wandered into the frenetic, powder-sugar dusted Cafe du Monde for an early cup of coffee and the famously fabulous fritters we had heard so much about. We were hot, sweaty, and more than a little worn out from having hoofed all over the historic district. It would take more than a few Dunkin Donuts to revive our exausted, jaded spirits and a whole lot more than a Krispee Kream to skewer our skepticism.The pastries needed to be fresh, hot, and Paris-pretty to impress us. The coffee had to be perfectly percolated to perk us up.What we had that morning (several plates of steaming, sinfully-sweet, precisely-powdered beignets) were tiny pillows of pastry perfection. The beignets were so good, we made several more early morning trips to Cafe du Monde during our stay in New Orleans. The coffee was utterly addictive, strong, lovely, full-bodied, with a rich aroma that could be detected long before we entered the shop.Once home, I experienced a serious post-perfect-beignet let-down. Krispee Kream no longer cut it. Starbucks was sadly unsatisfying.I was thrilled when I discovered I could buy Cafe du Monde's beignet mix and coffeee online. I ordered several boxes and cans, stocked up on a truck-load of powdered sugar, and anxiously waited by my mailbox. When the much-coveted beignet mix was finally delivered, I wasted no time in firing up the oil and brewing a pot of coffee.I was very pleased with the beignet mix and the chicory coffee. The directions were easy to follow (just add water) and the amount of mix in the box was generous for the price. Once properlly prepared, the beignets were just as delicious as those served at Cafe du Monde (of course, you do have that tiresome clean-up when you make them at home that you don't have when you go to the cafe in New Orleans, but all truly great things come with a price).Pefect patries and heavenly coffee.  Forget Starbucks!",5.0

1545,Just as I remembered!!,"As soon and I opened one of these little gems I was transported back to my childhood when I spent my summers with my beloved Nonna.My grandma had a store in Bridgeport Ct. I loved going there, It was one of those stores that had a grocery department in the front  and in the back was a butcher, there was saw dust on the floor and fish and hardware splattered around, on the counter my grandma would keep, under the rows of Italian sausage and big balls of aging chees, a basket full of Perugino nougat candy just like this one. Although these are not the same brand the are good enough to bring back fond memories of my times with my grandma.I would come in and call out ""Ciao Nonna"" and she would come and kiss my cheep and grab a couple of candies tell me how much she loved me and tap my bottom and send me on my way with my treat.I just cannot stop eating these, they are not exactly like the ones I remember, because it has been a very long time and tastes have changed but these are just as soft and sweet, chewy and still has nice crispy almonds.  If the almonds are stale they would be soft and chewy, not good.

I went back to the market and have since bought 3 more boxes of tea from different brands, and quality and size are easily noticeable; Stash PGT's leaves actually look like leaves, and not burnt up, shriveled sawdust. They leaves also have a pretty color, and aren't oxidized.Since I grew up on sugar laden drinks, drinking both teas without sugar was rough, but now that I'm used to it, these teas are just super tasty and don't even need a grain of sugar. I also cold brew my tea, rather than pour warm/scalding/hot water on it. I was reading on a forum that brewing teas in cold water helps to draw out more antioxidants. Cold brewed black tea is better for you than hot brewed oolong, believe it or not. Also, I can't stomach the flavor of warm/scalding/hot water tea. It's just...bleh. Cold-brewing tea is similar to making sun tea, except, it isn't placed in the sun. I ""brew"" my tea from anywhere between 15 min to 30 min.~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~Stash is a great starter tea if you've never seriously drunk tea before.

That is about 70% more than it sold for in the grovery store just a few months ago, before the price increase. The price increase, by the way, came in the way of reducing the chocolate blocks to half of their original size. I recommend that you boycott and not purchase Baker's Chocolate in protest.Edit: If the actual cost were 47 cents per ounce, that would be a good deal. But, with the $4.95 shipping fee, the cost per ounce becomes 62 cents per ounce ($19.95 divided by 32 ounces), which is not a good deal, at all.

My last hotel/travel interface with poor quality ground Lavazza pods has resulted in a new addition to my cosmetic bag-- a little Ziplock full of Senseo brand pods, which are decent if not superlative, fairly common in stores, and will accomodate many coffee coffee makers.  I thought the last Lavazza incident was just a bad batch, but it's statistically unlikely that it should keep happening every time.  If you have had better luck with specific blends, bless you, but I think it's not my crappy Karma, but their crummy coffee.  Just my two cents; your mileage may vary.  I use coffee to pry open the eyelids and I need to hit the ground running, so the first cup has to be acceptable.

1414,No longer cost effective; too expensive for what you get,"The Senseo pods are no longer a cost effective way of getting a quality cup of coffee. Looking through my order history, ""Back in the day"" a couple of years back this six pack of 18 pods used to hover around eighteen bucks; now it is double that. So I got curious and I cut a pod and compared it against the content of a K Cup - the Senseo pod contains about half the coffee of a regular KCup. This means one has to use two Senseo pods to match the strength of a KCup for the same size brew. This translates to Senseo being more expensive than an average K Cup bought in quantity here at Amazon.Maybe I got used to the coffee, but the Senseo pods no longer produce the bold aroma and taste that got me hooked a few years back; I defected to Keurig where I found a much richer variety and I don't regret it for a second.

6405,Kid-Friendly But ...,"This is definitely a kid-friendly, super-easy (open and heat) product. Easy to serve and usually welcomed with excitement by the under-7 set based on looks alone. BUT if you think these are a super-healthy option just because they are organic, you're definitely kidding yourself. Organic or not, this is still stuffed with sodium and preservatives, albeit of the more natural variety--it is, after all, canned, pre-cooked food. Better than a trip through the McDonald's drive thru? I'd say, yeah, probably, especially with a vegetable side. Healthier than just about any other non-prepackaged pasta option, organic or otherwise? Umm, not likely.As for taste, the reviewer who called these pasta in tomato soup just about nailed the flavor profile, though the mushy pasta wasn't pointed out (perhaps implied?). Honestly, in the one time we tried these, when my four-year-old was left with a babysitter that I don't really want to ask to cook anything, he was excited at first, but then barely ate any.In general, I think Annie's tends to make tasty, convenient products that are a healthier (note I didn't say ""healthy"") choice than similar products, but this one seems like a miss.

3701,Tasty but BUYER BEWARE OF SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUE,"I've tried many, though not all, of the Tasty Bite line of ""1 Step - 1 minute"" of products. This Madras Lentils ranks among the best. I think the spices are just right, with on major exception, detailed below, that applies to all their products that I've tried, the consistency is near perfect as the lentils are ""al dente"" (cooked to near perfection) IMHO. As with the entires Tasty Bite line up these are ideal for travel, quick lunches at work or home when you just don't have the time nor desire to spend preparing something. At current prices, they're a terrific value at less than $3 for a ""two serving"" package. Honestly though, unless you're on a near starvation diet, or half a package is being served as a very small side dish to a larger plate of food, I think most people will consume the entire package. I tend to, though I'm cutting back foe health purposes, and the whole package constitutes a full and with one major exception healthy meal; the exception being sodium.. If one is on a weight loss plan that focuses on high protein this is a near ideal product. The nutrition facts for the entire package are as follows:300 calories; 100 from fat . Broken down into detail and percentage IOC the recommended Daily Allowance based upon a 2,000 to 2,500 calories (not a weight loss level for mist people) per day diet, these are marked by the % sign in the details that follow:1. Total Fat 12 grams (18%), 5 grams of which are Saturated Fat (26%), 0 grams of which are Tran Fat2. Cholesterol is 20 mg (6%)3. Sodium: 1,020 mg or 42% of the RDA.  THIS IS EXTREMELY HIGH. Accordingly, if you've got a heart condition or are on a sodium restricted diet, or just don't want all that sodium in one meal then STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!4. Total Carbohydrates = 36 grams which = 12%. Of that, Dietary Fiber represents 10 grams (40%); a good thing for most people,while Sugars are a negligible 4 grams.5. You'll get 14 grams of Protein which will help you remain satiated for a good while.6. Finally, the vitamins and minerals content are:Vitamin A - 12%;Vitamin C - 8%;Calcium - 8% and;Iron - a handsome 28%.REMEMBER, THE ABOVE VALUES ARE FOR THE ENTIRE PACKAGE, WHICH IS TECHNICALLY CONSIDERED TWO SERVINGS. I feel this is a better representation to go by because based upon the percentage of reviews that address the portion size at the time of this review, most people I believe consume the entire package at or for one meal.In summary, with the exception of the sodium, this is a relatively healthy product, and one that is well-suited for a lot of weight loss programs. The sodium should not be taken lightly though. It's widely believed that Americans have much to much salt in their diets and if you read the nutritional value of the plethora of products consumed and add to that the amount of table salt people add to their food, you'll understand why I reach this conclusion.Without the sodium though, this us a ""near perfect"" product from a dietary health perspective. It's the sodium content that causes me to give this three stars instead of five. It's too bad that Tasty Bite didn't play around with adding some other herbs and spices that would have allowed them to reduce the sodium and still end up with a palatable and desirable food item.",3.0

4807,Add it to your homemade potato salad for rave reviews!,"My family has always used Old Bay Seasoning for steaming crabs and shrimp, and I also add a small amount to other fish dishes.  A few years ago, however, I discovered what would be my favorite use for it...potato salad.I have never liked deli potato salad and am pretty picky about homemade.  My sister-in-law made some for a party, and it was the best I had ever eaten.  I asked her what her secret was, and she ran down the usual list of potato salad ingredients.  Then she told me she added Old Bay Seasoning.  Bingo!  That was it.I went straight home and made my homemade potato salad, grabbed my can of Old Bay, and sprinkled away.  I can't say exactly how much I use, because I never measure ingredients when I'm making my own recipes.  Just add some, stir it up, and taste....add some, stir it up, and taste till you like it.  The seasoning does not overpower the salad flavor at all, just enhances it.  Don't be concerned that there is going to be a crab or shrimp taste to your salad; it isn't the Old Bay that makes crabs and shrimp taste like seafood.  Old Bay just makes seafood taste better, and now potato salad too.  Try it on your homemade potato salad; I think you'll love it.",5.0

Although it lists itself as chamomile and lavender, the flavor is predominantly a nice licorice, which combined with the other ingredients, is more like anise. It is also a moderately sweet tea. I'd call this a 'rich and full-bodied' herbal tea. And, although I'm not a big ""traditional remedy"" person, there do seem to be some real benefits to this and Relaxed Mind. However, it might be as much due to the enjoyment of a nice hot, flavorful cup of tea, as it is due to the herbs in the tea.Either way, the tea is full of flavor, and relaxing. Enjoy!",5.0
2071,*NOT* a Dark Roast!  *NOT* an Espresso Roast.  More like Medium; not flavorful.,"I bought this coffee expecting a dark roast to use in my espresso machine.  I know it's an italian roast but it's much more medium to light than other italian roasts I've had.  The color of the beans is similar to the top of the bag (a medium brown), not oily at all (in fact, they look completely dry).  Whether this is normal or not for this roast, I don't know.All the other italian, and dark/full-bodied roasts I've had have been much darker, bordering on blackish, and have at least some oil on the bean surface.This coffee brews extremely light as an espresso.  I'd say it's nutty and a bit sweet as well. Lacks depth & complexity.  It is smooth, but so is water.  There are no of those darker-roast flavors (smoky, chocolate, toast, etc.) or heartiness.If you're a fan of espresso, french roast, sumatra, and other bold/dark-roasts, this coffee is not for you.  I wish I could return this.",1.0
3854,Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!,"Buyer Beware Please!  This sweetner is not for everybody. Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body. You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell. I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before. I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping. As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant. Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetner could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market. The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetner* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little.  I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ... it's the maltitol!",1.0

The drink was good, but nothing to write home about. However, they were quite refreshing and had an interesting mix of ingredients I liked. Next, I gave the chocolate variety a try. Oh, this was much better. It tasted like a less-creamy chocolate milk. Quite good. The calories were somewhat high at 110 per 14-ounce serving. The potassium content was way over the sodium, which was good. It was higher in sugar than I like. The protein and fat content was negligible. So, it's a good drink. Very tasty. But I have a few reservations about it centered around the sugar content and the calories.Gary Peterson",3.0

1942,"Works pretty well, especially for ticks","I have two Maltese dogs and was at my wits end when I found this product.  The people behind me had brought in two puppies, covered with ticks, and promptly shared them with the entire neighborhood.  Nocturnal visits by cats, plus several squirrels running around in my yard, brought in fleas, and I could NOT get rid of them.  Maltese dogs have really long, thick hair and my poor little dogs were just miserable.  I had to have all their hair cut off (which I usually do in the summer) in the early spring, while it was still very cold at night and in the morning.  And I STILL couldn't get rid of the fleas and ticks.  My male dog is allergic to Advantix and Frontline didn't even slow the ticks down.  So I was looking for some other kind of help when I found this product.  I had heard some people say it worked and others said it didn't, but I decided it was worth a try and I'm really glad I tried it.  It doesn't get rid of every flea or tick on my dogs, but, where I was finding a bunch of fleas and picking ticks off my dogs by the dozens, every day, I am now finding an occasional flea and maybe one or two ticks on my dogs every day.  My little girl dog is a big eater and she loves to eat her pill.  My finicky-eater boy has to have his crushed and dropped into his mouth.  Once it's there, he likes it pretty well and will go ahead and swallow it.  Bottom line:  it worked pretty well for my dogs and there is no garlic smell that I can detect.  I think it was well worth the money.",4.0

3679,My Favorite Tasty Bite Dish,"In reading the reviews I am surprised that the appearance of this dish is repeatedly mentioned. I didn't notice what some other reviewers view as a disgusting appearance. Perhaps it is because my first experience with this product was a few years ago in a food sampling. Small cup, not a big plateful and I focused on the intense flavors, and the fact that the base is spinach -- something I love and don't consume enough.Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I adore this dish. The smell is distinctive -- decidedly earthy --which I relish. The paneer cheese is very light and soft with a texture like silken tofu, but the flavor is of a mild cheese. The cheese serves as a perfect counterpoint to the spicy spinach. Going against tradition I sometimes add a small amount of cooked brown rice, but I prefer the dish undiluted. And, I found the cheese chunks plentiful.The ingredients -- spinach, water, tomatoes, paneer cheese, onions, sunflower oil, salt, garlic, cornstarch, chilies, cumin are startling in their simplicity. Where is the long list of chemicals? Grabbing a convenience meal often means sacrificing both flavor and health -- this gluten free, Kosher dish sacrifices nothing. I will buy this dish as long as Tasty Bite continues to produce it.",5.0

Consumers beware that sugar is the NUMBER ONE ADDITIVE used by Campbells and it is the NUMBER ONE ADDICTIVE substance that people suffer from.  Read labels. Campbells ought to know better to be upfront--- and stop loading up the consumers with sugar instead of REAL TOMATO, pure vegetable ingredients. And, in case anyone wants to be informed, there are many DECEPTIVE LABELS MANUFACTURERS USE TO call sugar AND THEY ARE ALL THE SAME CHEMICALLY; SUCH AS DEXTROSE, MALTODEXTRIN, SUCROSE, SUCRALOSE, CORN SYRUP, ORGANIC sugar (I love this one, so it is made without fertilizers,---- NOTHING IS HEALTHY ABOUT SUGAR)",1.0

This is a mellow, smooth yet strong Coffee with a pleasant after taste that you will enjoy how it lingers after you're finished with your last cup for the morning. French Market (it's only competitor) is bitter, too strong, the last cup in the pot is almost undrinkable, and you need to wash your mouth out with something with something that will get the bitterness out of your mouth it's so bad.

This box of 100 contains the small sized sticks - about 4 inches long, individually wrapped, and stored in a dispenser box.  They don't have to be refrigerated, which makes them easy to tuck into a purse or lunch box.These aren't the ""spicy"" flavor - I think you have to order the jalapeno or tabasco flavor to get those.  But these are *slightly* spicy, chewy and delicious.  Nobody eats Slim Jims because they're health food - they contain preservatives and low grade meats.  But for a quick snack or if you just want something spicy, these are the same yummy snacks you'll remember from your childhood.  They are also high protein and zero carbs, which is good for those who are dieting.I've ordered this box three times and have been happy with it every time.

If it absolutely the best that you are willing or able to provide, it serves some purpose.  There was no discernible foreign flavor to the finished product although the boiling pasta gave off a distinct broccoli-laden aroma.  As far as flavor, this does not seem to be as cheesy as the regular version so for kids deeply familiar with the original, it may take a bit of convincing.  If boxed meals are standard for your family, choose the ones that offer the largest amount of disguised nutrition, knowing that it can in no way be compared to the flavor or health benefits of the real thing.",3.0

Not only is it free of dairy and soy (along with wheat, I cannot digest legumes, and many gluten free products seem to rely on bean flour), but it makes TWO layers of cake.

Particularly their classic sauce, which just doesn't hold up flavor-wise once you start to branch out and try other types of hot-sauces.But I will contend that this variation, the Chipotle flavor, is fairly decent.  As with regular Tabasco, the flavor is problematic due to the overwhelming taste of vinegar.  But I do find myself enjoying the smokey, tangy notes of this sauce once you get past that initial &#34;Blech!&#34; of the overbearing vinegar flavor.  I don't think it works necessarily as a topping, but those notes of smoke and tang do make it a good addition in recipes.  I find myself using a few spoon-fulls, along with straight cayenne sauce and Ghost Pepper sauce in chili and other similar dishes to give some good flavor.I'm not too familiar with Chipotle products/sauces/foods, but I definitely am interested after trying this.This is one of the few Tabasco products I would definitely recommend people give a shot.

There's a slight bump in fiber and vitamin c, but nothing truly noteworthy.  Perhaps because the true veggie worth is ""about"" (their word, not mine) 1/2 serving of vegetables per 1 cup serving of mac & cheese.That said, the taste change is not starkly different from the original.  I usually make my mac & cheese with some broccoli, tomatoes, or other veggies anyway so this can be a good supplement.  I don't think the drop in quantity from the regular blue box (5.5oz v 7.25oz, or 2 servings v 3 servings) is worth the ""health"" tradeoff, and it seems most likely a marketing justification to sell you less for more (hey, it's a rough economy for Kraft, too, especially with corn and flour prices rising).Overall it seems a wash to me.  If you are desperate to sneak in any amount of veggies then buy this.  Otherwise, price being equal, I'd recommend the regular mac & cheese, with its extra serving, and just add a few veggies of your own.",3.0

I can actually still smell it even though I sealed them back up. The seller is JR Mushrooms & Specialties, shipped from Amazon Warehouse with 2-day prime shipping. The beans didn't seem hot upon arrival either, most likely because of the storms we've been getting in the area keeping it cooler.I must also say my hands are smooth from handling all the beans from the oils.I used some of these to make vanilla extract.

I have found a tablespoon of coconut oil in a microwave popper to be the best so far but I still have a poor popping ratio of only about 50%.

I may give it a try again this summer as I purchased some seed to plant and will harvest my own.,2.0
5295,Waaay to salty to enjoy.,"I tried really hard to like the product (it comes in a case of 12 after all) but I just could not take the taste. It looks like regular chili, has some fat like regular chili, has a texture like regular chili, and it almost tastes good, if you can get past the salt.This is the second, and last, of this brand and type of veggie product I will try. They rely too much on salt to compensate for the perceived lack of flavor from real meat. A much better, IMHO, veggie chili can be made with some diced onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers, a hot chile of your choice, garlic, oregano, chili powder, a little masa, tomato paste, and one or more types of beans, like pintos, kidneys, mayo coba, etc. Just a pinch of salt and your done, or add your own meat or substitute if you have to.I hope there are some vegetarians at the food bank.Edit: I'll add that many canned foods tend to be a little salty to me, so we don't eat too many of them. I will say that compared to other canned chilis I have tried, vegetarian or not, this compared favorably. But, I can't take salt out of a prepared food whereas others can always add salt. This was the deal breaker for me, as it is with other prepared, canned chilis.",2.0

8768,Great Pasta with chicken flavor! (no actual chicken in the mix.),"This is a great tasting, creamy, pasta dish. To cut the salt, use less of the seasoning packet (save rest to flavor gravy or soup.) Use 1 Tlbs each unsalted butter & oil for creamy. Using oil alone isn't great in this pasta - if you do, select a high quality EVOO (Extra Virgin olive oil) instead of other bland oils. Freeze the extra boxes and if you do find bugs, they're dead and can easily be picked out, then you rinse the pasta and proceed. Add a can of chicken for a main dish that feeds two adults. Our case arrived with no problems and no bugs. Great dish for the elderly, also, since pasta is small and creamy, easy to eat. Try it!",5.0

1522,I was surprised there was no lactofermentation involved,"When you make this kimchi according to the instructions, you essentially are letting the cabbage soak overnight in brine, then draining it and mixing in a packet of ground spices before sticking it immediately into the refrigerator to let the flavors marry. This is NOT the same thing as fermenting a batch of kimchi for days at room temperature so that those wonderful fermentation bubbles build up and render the special ""tang on the tongue"" that I realized (after making this) is critical to good kimchi.I also found the flavor strange, too sweet and also a little ""off"" in a way I cannot describe. I didn't weigh my cabbage, but I selected a standard-sized Napa head so it had to be in the ballpark of four pounds. But the flavor of the packet overwhelmed the cabbage completely. I wound up rinsing off as much as I could, then stuffing the cabbage back into a mason jar and putting it under airlock on the counter to see if I can salvage the batch. The verdict is still out.I'm not a kimchi purist or connoisseur, but I know enough to know this isn't what I like. I'm going back to Sandor Katz' technique fromWild Fermentation: The Flavor, Nutrition, and Craft of Live-Culture Foodsand see if I can't get closer to something I can't stop eating. Maybe I can work some of this product into the recipe somewhere along the way and it'll be magic, and I do hope this is the case because I've got 11 packets left.",2.0

4236,"Good to have on hand for an emergency (ie disaster) or for disaster response, would not eat for everyday - too little nutrition","I first found the Betty Crocker Sweet Mashed Potatoes when on a disaster deployment and needed something I could ""cook"" on a moments notice for lunches at the office or dinner back in my travel trailer (imagine living in a travel trailer in the Great Plains as autumn is setting in and the nearest standing ""restaurant"" is a ""diner"" 10 miles away and the next real place to get a hot meal is a diner over 30 minutes away... and full of tough looking guys from the railroad..There are 2 pouches each containing about 3 'servings' in each box. Quite frankly, one pouch is perfect for a larger individual meal with maybe a sandwich or a piece of fish or a small steak or even as a quick side to a fast food burger (anything is better than french fries sitting in the warmer for too long...)Note it does NOT take 8 Minutes to prepare - I set the water kettle or coffee pot to make hot water, dump the pouch into a bowl, add a pad of butter (preferably real!), toss in a dash of pepper, pour the now ready hot water into the bowl, fluff with a fork and let sit while I'm pouring my drink and gathering up the main item to set on the table (usually next to the laptop, who has time NOT to work - or surf the 'net - in these situations?!)So in a pinch, such as while on a disaster deployment living in a travel trailer or in a hotel room with just a coffee pot (hot water), these packets are GREAT!!!

The only real convenience is the box can be stored for an emergency where the potato (sweet or otherwise) will go bad in a fair amount of time.

Yikes, these are going to hard to get rid of.  A previous reviewer states that they are like fish food and I second that notion.  I would definitely recommend steering clear of these, and choosing one of the much better flavors like cheese.  I don't know exactly how to describe these, but imagine a stale sock soaked in broccoli juice and you're on the right track.  My typically non-discriminating 14 month old turns his nose up at these.  These taste like something super healthy, and though they aren't bad for you, they are not healthy enough to warrant choking them down.  They are worth a try as a toddler snack, but I'd order cautiously or you will have lots of fish food tasting snacks that you will be trying to give away to any unsuspecting victim that will take them off of your hands.",2.0

The new crisps looks like they kept them in the oven for an hour too long. They are paper thin now, very crunchy, burnt colored, burnt tasting, and I think they left the salt off.  And when you open a bag don't be surprised to find mostly broken pieces inside instead of whole crisps. I've opened two bags so far and 50% of them are broken into tiny pieces. They are so thin and fragile now.Just beware before you buy a case of these that they have changed very much. I'd suggest finding a bag in a grocery store first and trying them out before investing in an entire case of a very changed product.A big thumbs down to Genisoy on this one!",1.0
4380,Can't Live With Out This Stuff.,"So I know there is a warning that you should not drink these teas if you are pregnant or breastfeeding but I want to remind you that just about every product out there has that warning on it for legal reasons. Even their Mother's Milk tea has that warning and it is made specifically to help women increase their breast milk supply while breastfeeding. With that said...I am breastfeeding and have been for a long time. Before I found these teas I would suffer through a sore throat, stuffy nose, cold, etc with out taking medication because I didn't want my baby/toddler to get any through my breast milk. Herbal remedies are much gentler on your body so I feel very comfortable knowing that these herbs will be passed to my child instead of a strong chemical remedy like DayQuil. I make my teas very strong and add some local raw honey for even more health benefits, and it makes the teas taste even better. I do enjoy the taste of the teas much more than I thought I would since they are after all medical remedies. The teas are not miracle cures but they really do help and you don't get a doped up feeling like you do from a lot of the OTC meds out there. I'm not sure I have a favorite, I find they are all really nice to have on hand when you need them. I also enjoy just drinking them, mainly the Cold Care and Echinacea, as a nice cup of tea on a cold day.Buy one box and see what you think, I don't think you'll be disappointed.***EDIT***I just wanted to add that while in general herbs are pretty safe when breastfeeding you do not want to take them as supplements or eat/drink extremely large amounts of them with out first making sure they are safe. You would probably have to drink an entire box of this stuff in one day for it to really cause any problems with breastfeeding so if you drink the typical 1-6 cups (using 1 tea bag per cup, 6 cups steeped with 2 tea bags each might be a little much) you should be fine.***EDIT***Just found out from my midwife that although these teas are safe to drink while breastfeeding they are not safe to drink while pregnant, except for the Echinacea which is safe to drink while pregnant. Bummer! I guess my 6 boxes will be sitting in the pantry for the next 9 months.",5.0

I'm partial to beef jerky, certain types of chips and Snickers bars. Just not too often.These Slim Jims will not be joining my short-list. They are, I guess, sausages of a sort--foot long tubes about a 3/8 of an inch in diameter. The outer skin is taut and crispy. The inside is soft and somewhat mushy.They are made with beef and chicken, but there is no discernible meat flavor--just spice heat. I guess they would be a good accompaniment to a beer or two, but I can think of other things (salsa and corn chips, flavored pretzels, etc.) that I'd rather have with that beverage.Nutrition on these is hair-raising, even for a guilty pleasure. A less than one ounce snack which will deliver 140 calories, 23% of your daily allotment of saturated fat and 20% of your sodium, not to mention some nitrite--that's pretty hard-core.Sorry, Jim.

6589,Vicks Vapor Rub,"I'm really curious as to what ""blended black tea"", means.

In removing it from the wrapper, it had such a strong aroma of Vick's Vapor Rub, that it gave me second thoughts as to whether it was safe to drink. However, I did want to try it, so here I am, alive and still kicking. The only positive thing I can say is that it has a nice cinnamon flavor that pleasantly lingers in my mouth, and the packaging is easy on the eyes. Not sure what the manufacturers were thinking though, in putting this product out in the public arena as a beverage. The ingredients are: blended black tea, ginger root, cinnamon, cinnamon oil, clove oil, allspice, nutemeg, clove, and cardamon oil.

The ficus is great if you have little natural light.  My apartment is very dark and the tree did fine off of the artificial light.  That said, this is NOT a tree for beginners.  Ficus are notoriously finicky.  They like regular water and the same light conditions day after day.  Each time you vary the routiine significantly, it will drop all of its leaves.  Moreover, this plant was hard to water.  The pot doesn't have enough room for the water to soak in, so I had to use a spray bottle and lots of patience.  It needs to be watered daily.In short: good choice if you just don't have any good light, bad, bad choice for a first Bonsai or if you are forgetful or travel.",3.0

The thickness and the taste of flowers (you can get an idea of what types of flowers the bees visited) give this particular brand a light, floral taste.My bottle had a crystallized layer at the top that was almost waxy.  This added to the flavor and texture and was not a problem.  As others have mentioned, this can be softened by placing the bottle in hot water.

6978,Think Thin Chocolate Fudge Bar,"This review is for the Chocolate Fudge flavor of the Think Thin Bars.  In a word, yuck.  This bar may be all kinds of nutritious, but you have to want to eat it for that to take any effect.The taste and texture was kind of like eating cocoa powder dusted Styrofoam.  It was kind of chewy and soft all at the same time and the only flavor, aside from a dry flat taste, was the cocoa powder.  And it was more like a milk chocolate for the cocoa powder as it had that kind of sour aftertaste.  Needless to say, I didn't enjoy it.The ingredients are decent.  The following is the ingredients list copied from Think Thin's website:PROTEIN BLEND (WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE, SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE, CALCIUM CASEINATE, CASEIN) GLYCERIN, MALTITOL, COATING (MALTITOL, COCOA BUTTER, CHOCOLATE, SODIUM CASEINATE, MILK FAT, SOY LECITHIN, NATURAL FLAVORS, SALT), ALMONDS, WATER, CANOLA OIL, CHOCOLATE, ALKALIZED COCOA, SOY LECITHIN, NATURAL FLAVORS, SEA SALT.You would think since it was real chocolate and cocoa butter that it would have been a bit better tasting, but all I can think is that perhaps they used low grade chocolate.  And I was really surprised to see almonds listed in there, I didn't taste them at all.  And using Maltitol for the sweetener, I would have preferred stevia or even just a tiny bit of cane sugar (yes I realize part of this products boast is having 0 grams of sugar, but a tiny bit wouldn't hurt).  Still, for a protein bar this isn't a bad list in comparison to other brands.This product is certified to be gluten free and it is sugar free unlike many bars out there.  So it is unique in that aspect and good for those on special diets.  There's 240 calories per bar, but this is meant to be a meal replacement or training snack, not a regular snack.  8 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber are in it along with 20 grams of protein, which is a lot.  And while there is no sugar, sugar alcohol is present as 12 grams of this bar.I wouldn't buy these again.  At least not in this flavor.  Perhaps some of the others are a little better tasting.  But I couldn't even finish this bar I thought it tasted so bad, and I'm not normally one to waste food.  But, perhaps with different taste buds, someone could enjoy this enough to reap its nutritional benefits.Review by M. Reynard 2013",2.0

4958,Strange flavor,"This doesn't taste like any cream of broccoli soup I've ever had...not even the regular canned, condensed version from Campbell's.  Very disappointing.  I gave it to my local soup kitchen along with some other canned goods.  I wouldn't have been able to eat it myself.",1.0
3167,Not recommended,"I tasted this product at a friend's house. I had to use a lot more of it than I do with pure stevia, and I realized why when I examined the product label and researched information on the product on the NuNaturals website. This product is mostly maltodextrin. This is what is stated in the product information from NuNaturals: ""Add NuStevia to sweeten your favorite food or beverage, 1/4 tsp is as sweet as 1 tsp of sugar. For recipes, 4 tbs [1/4 cup] is as sweet as 1 cup of sugar.""Pure stevia powder is presumed to be 200 times as sweet as sugar. Individual perceptions of sweetness may vary, but I personally find the best brands of pure stevia to be about 40 times as sweet as sugar. Given that the stevia powder used in this product is at best, per the company's own admission, only about 4 times as sweet as sugar, that means that this product is only about one-tenth stevia.For my own consumption, I much prefer to purchase100% pure stevia powder. I'm not a fan of maltodextrin mixed with stevia, and certainly not of natural flavors added to any food I consume which are, for reasons unknown, added to this product. I explain what those ingredients are below.Ingredients: Maltodextrin, stevia extract and natural flavors. Free of soy, MSG, yeast, gluten, wheat, milk, synthetics, artificial colors or flavors, preservatives, saccharin, aspartame, sucralose, or artificial sweeteners.Maltodextrin: This is a food additive that is either without taste or slightly sweet. It is commonly used in the processed-food industry as a thickener or filler, to improve the texture and appearance in processed food. As a relatively cheap ingredient, it can also add more bulk to a given product, thereby increasing profits for the company using it. In the U.S., most of the time it is derived from rice, corn, or potato starch. Through a process called hydrolysis, the starch is reduced to its basic amino acids. Then an enzyme is used to break it down even further, resulting in a powder that instantly dissolves in water. Products such as jams and powdered substances which contain maltodextrin are required by law to say ""wheat"" in the the nutrition labeling if the maltodextrin is derived from wheat.Natural Flavor: The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: ""The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional"" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is.",2.0

7036,Not a good taste,"The Chocolate Espresso flavor of the thinkThin bars is the only one I have tasted and I found it disappointing.  There was no coffee flavor to the bar other than bitterness.  Is that supposed to be the espresso flavor?  I have tasted many other things with a better coffee flavor.  The chocolate flavor is strong but more of a baking chocolate flavor, not candy flavor.  Of course since the bar contains zero sugar, barely any fat, and is gluten free, it isn't going to have a ""rich"" flavor to it. It contains 20 grams of protein but only 10% Calcium and 15% Iron for the RDA.  It leaves a strong after taste that made me grab for a beverage to get rid of it.  If you like a bitter chocolate flavor, then you would like this bar.  Personally I won't be eating another of this flavor.",1.0
8684,Pasty Sometimes,"If you follow the directions and add the amount of water they say, it can get pasty.  If you microwave it as long as the box says, it can also get pasty.

7594,Get Myojo Udon instead,"I'm astounded how much praise Annie Chun keeps getting for her noodles. When I see people practically orgasming at how wonderful they are, this tells me they don't have much experience with this type of product.Don't get me wrong-- her noodles aren't the worst thing I've ever had (except this one horrible exception!), but there are better tasting noodles for literally half of what her noodles cost. For example, Myojo Udon puts out these delectable packets (seeMyojo Udon Japanese Style Noodles with Soup Base, Chicken Flavor, 7.22-Ounce Bag (Pack of 15)) that can be had for about a dollar and they are way more flavorful than this particular bowl. (Don't buy them from Amazon, though, get them at your local Asian grocer's or trusty online retailer).Of course, the Myojo Udon type noodles aren't as ""easy"" to prepare as Annie Chun bowls (you can't really nuke them in a microwave; you have to boil them, then add a flavor packet). But in the end, the taste is worth the extra hassle. I would sooner take a one dollar pack of flavorful udon noodles that took 5-6 minutes to prepare on a stovetop over a watered down version that took 3 minutes in a microwave.",2.0

I was looking for a lavender herb blend, and while this has no lavender in it, my research concludes that herbs de provence should not contain lavender...lavender is often added as a touristy/American/snobby thing. I've used this in spaghetti sauce -- delicious. I've also used it with just olive oil, lemon and parmesan on pasta --excellent. It has added nice flavor to soup and stew as well. I think it's the savory that makes everything I put it on taste so good. One tip is a must when using any dried herb: be sure to rub it roughly between your palms to break out the freshness. It will now be a staple in my spice library.",5.0

5438,"Enfamil is okay, but maybe not so much the soy version","I imagine that this soy formula is great for some who cannot tolerate the average formula or milk, but for my baby (5 months) he could not tolerate it. It must taste differently than normal formula. I also breastfeed regularly so I'm sure that this has affected his preferences, but our first experience with this soy based formula was not a good one.Not only did he resist taking it, but once he did it made him super gassy. That said, I've had three kids now and I feel that Enfamil is a well trusted brand. My first child would not breastfeed no matter how hard I tired, and so Enfamil and Similac were what she lived off of, but my other two babies did breastfeed so luckily I only had to use formula as a supplement in rare occasions.Enfamil is a fine brand, but I'd only recommend the soy version if your child can absolutely not tolerate regular formula, which must taste more like real milk since all of my kids have taken to regular formula with much more ease.",3.0

I've never had more than 2 blueberries in a serving and more often find only 1 blueberry. I don't detect any cinnamon whatsoever. If you're really looking for either the blueberry or cinnamon taste, keep looking.But, this is still a good value - I buy this brand of oatmeal because it's organic and good for me. It's a decent product but should be relabeled or improved so that it reflects the labeling. I'll buy this brand again but not this flavor.",3.0
3954,Ok product....,"A decent, middle of the road hamburger helper flavor. It tastes very similar to a salisbury steak with gravy.

I prefer a drier, more flavorful jerky -- the kind you have to chew for a while and exercise your jaw muscles. This jerky requires minimal effort to chew before it disintegrates. I like the organic-ness of it, and the ingredient list is devoid of anything scary. All-in-all, it's decent, but I might not buy this particular flavor again.",3.0

We use stevia at home but it seems that stevia in processed products takes on a weirder flavour - to me anyways.  I do not find that this tea relaxes me either but something in it feels like a stimulant.  I will go back to my valerian, stinky but simple, clean and relaxing.",2.0

But what is more share worthy is the fact that it is a great tea for children that suffer from motion sickness.Our oldest daughter used to be car sick all the time. We carried an endless supply of ""baggies"" for her as she would 8 out of 10 times relieve herself when commuting back and forth to school.We discovered that this tea, given 20 minutes before the ride and every hour or so on long family trips curtailed her horrid events completely.

This is a basic hot sauce - peppers, vinegar, and salt - and it can be used as you would Tabasco or a Louisiana hot sauce.  Unfortunately, it's extremely mild.  I often find that, in order to add the desired heat to food, I have to add so much that the food becomes watery.  My scrambled eggs end up a mess and still taste bland.

295,Kick to it,"I will preface this review with a little about myself. I only recently bought a ""hottest sauce"" while at a kind of flea market in England. It was also a ghost pepper sauce and i was shocked at the intensity of the burn. At first I was sort of proud of myself for being able to use it, but it did grow on me and I started using it as an actual condiment.  After the bottle ran out I thought I would see what was on Amazon and this sauce was ranked very highly so I bought it. So I really only have one other sauce to compare this to but here goes:The sauce is very hot. Almost too hot. It has a pasty consistency, almost exactly like tomato paste. Very finely ground. It has a more gummy consistency to it, like theres something added to it to give it a smoother texture though there's no such actual ingredient.What there is, however, as someone else pointed out, is pepper extract. It's the second listed ingredient so there must be a considerable amount. Perhaps it's what's giving this sauce that slimy texture I was eluding to earlier. This Pepper Extract doesn't state what KIND of pepper, and as it's an extract I imagine it must have gone through quite the extraction process.So what I'm getting at is this: the sauce feels more like a pepper extract, something which you should add small amounts of to large dishes for adding pure spice to the food. But it's missing the taste and feel of an actual hot sauce. There's little flavor, just a lot of burn. And I have to say that that's a big shame because the bhut jolokia pepper is very tasty. Almost fruity if I remember correctly.So I give this hot sauce 4 stars for the Effort and the level of spice, but I won't give it 5 stars because I think that goes to the generic bhut jolokia ghost pepper sauces with all the scary names and pictures on the bottle. The one I had was Fear Hot Sauce with a scary ghost woman on it, and it was much more like salsa, with little ground up pieces of ghost peppers and seeds in it and equal to, if not more burn than this one.If I change my mind as I go through this bottle, I'll update or comment on here again.",4.0

3321,Awesome product to have on hand.,"We have chickens for fresh eggs but in storing up for long term food storage and for using in baking, this is an awesome idea.  Now, we are spoiled with our fresh eggs but if using these dry ones and if a person mixes something in with them for an egg scramble, they become 'okay'.  It's all in what you add and how you season and let's face it, they are dry so nothing will taste like the real thing.  Dry goods like this are awesome because you can make your own mixes ahead of time and just add liquid, which saves a lot of time if you are in a pinch.I recommend everyone have some on their shelf.",5.0

I have no use now for all these pretzels and i can't imagine anyone enjoying this taste!It is upsetting to see that a few others also ended up with the High Protein pretzels having this awful BURNT flavor and yet they still kept sending them out.

At only 50g, one will survive an occasional indulgence--convenient for lunch box, aircraft carryon, etc.  The taste is pretty good, IMHO.  Lots of wheat though--gluten doesn't like me much.

I just received my 1st order of dried Shiitake Mushrooms this afternoon, and was very disappointed to find that the contents were very dusty, with many broken mushroom caps and pieces, instead of whole caps.  The box that they were packaged in had been damaged, as well.

8006,Absolutely NOT Diabetic Friendly,"I'm always appalled to see fellow diabetics extoll the virtues of many sugar free products because many of them contain a substance called ""maltodextrin"" which is every bit as bad (if not worse) than cane sugar for causing super spikes in blood glucose.Notice in the ingredients list, the first two ingredients are a modified food starch and maltodextrin made from corn. So....starch and corn (which is also a starch). The way the law reads, those who produce food products don't have to add certain substances to the nutrition information, they only have to list them in the ingredient list. Ingredient lists always go from most to least and by that I mean the first item on the list makes up more of the product than anything else. The second item is the 2nd most and so on so this sugar free jello is primarily made up of starch and maltodextrin from corn and if that wasn't bad enough, you're going to add milk to this product which is more simple carbs. There are over 11 grams of carbs in 1 cup of milk. You would be much better off to just eat a regular sized chocolate bar than to eat this sugar free product.This product might say in the nutrition information that it's sugar free and carb free but that obviously is NOT TRUE because the ingredients say it's not true. They've added food starch and maltodextrin.My endocrinologist said that pretty much everyone should try to avoid ingesting very much maltodextrin but especially if you are diabetic, pre-diabetic, have a family history of diabetes or are pregnant (gestational diabetes).The really sad thing is that much of the time maltodextrin adds NOTHING to the product - not flavor, certainly not nutrition. It is a cheap low calorie/no calorie filler.Maltodextrin is in sugar free jello, sugar free jello pudding, many sugar free hot beverage mixes such as Maxwell House sugar free coffee drink mixes and it's in many sugar free liquid coffee creamers and I could go on and on. Please, if you are diabetic, READ the label and not just the nutrition info.When I was diagnosed with diabetes in January 2012, my average blood sugar was in the 290's and my A1C was a whopping 11.7!I figured out on my own that maltodextrin was bad and began researching it. Once I cut out all products with maltodextrin in them my blood sugar readings quickly normalized and when I went back to my physician at the beginning of April 2012 my A1C was 6.5 so I was able to reduce it to a much better level within just a few months. I could never have done that without cutting out the maltodextrin.Another bad thing about maltodextrin is it can adversely affect your appetite. Anytime you have big fluctuations in your blood sugar, it also causes fluctuations in appetite which can make it hard to stick with any kind of eating program.I've been following a low carb/high fiber diet for years now because my husband, though a normal weight and very active, was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes almost a decade ago. I was sort of shocked when I was diagnosed with it and I'll always wonder if we had just known about substances like maltodextrin that react so negatively on the pancreas if I could have avoided the disease or at least held it off until later in life and I cried when I realized that all this time, I've been buying sugar free stuff for my husband thinking it was okay because his nutritionist never said a WORD about maltodextrin (and other substances like dextrose, sorbitol, etc that also react on the pancreas) and the reality is that I was making his diabetes/insulin resistance WORSE.I hope this helps someone out there. Wish I'd have known about it much sooner.",1.0

It really eats more like a stew than a pea soup, but it's flavorful and filling.The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the quality of the meat. It's not bad, but it's not 5-stars, either. A bit tough and not enough fat content to be interesting, it's really just a textural variation in the stew.",4.0

8130,Underwhelmed...,"I received a couple of these Breakfast Blend K-Cups in a variety pack and decided to give them a shot - I've always been pretty pleased with Green Mountain coffee (several of their other blends are on my Wish List) and with them sitting there in the box  I figured ""why not?"" - I'm always up for something different. Full disclosure: I'm usually a medium-dark kind of coffee drinker, and can easily drink a French Press bold brew without adding any milk or cream. Still, I can enjoy a good light roast when I come across one, and I'm sorry to say that Green Mountain's breakfast blend was simply not to my liking. I'm writing this review after having finished a cup of this coffee, and here are my thoughts as they come:It's not that the initial flavor is bad, but generally it has a strange aftertaste, tasting more like watered-down coffee than lightly-roasted beans. Contrary to popular belief, lightly roasted coffee blends are not supposed to be weak - they ARE supposed to be light in taste, but ""light"" and ""weak"" are two very different words in the coffee world. A light blend should be FULL of a light flavor, and personally I didn't find this to be the case with GM's breakfast blend.Still, reading through the reviews it seems like many people enjoy the taste, and I won't fault them for it - coffee (like wine, cheese and most of gastronomy) is so subjective sometimes that there's no way I'm going to not recommend at least giving this a try to people who typically enjoy light blends. I would, however, suggest buying a smaller count to give it a try first (or find it in a variety pack like I did). That way if you hate it, you're not stuck with 49 K-Cups to force down. If you DO like this coffee, buying this 50-pack works out to costing just a hair over $0.50 per cup - one of the best values you can find when looking for K-Cups. This blend was not for me, and I probably won't ever be buying it again, but if you DO enjoy it then the value alone makes it recommendable!Initial taste: 7/10Aftertaste: 6/10Value: 10/103.5/5 Stars overall.",3.0

7021,Think Thin because you won't be able to eat it.,"Yuck!  This has GOT to be the worse tasting bar I have ever eaten.  It tastes like you are chocking down a bunch of chemicals. Yes, yes I KNOW it says ""all natural"" but really it's gross. I looked up the ingredient list (the ingredient list IS on the back of the bar but on my bar Amazon stuck a sticker right on top of it) and it maybe a form of natural ingredients or maybe what USE TO BE natural ingredients but it's not anymore.Also if you are really looking to avoid products such as MSG, and GMOs this bar isn't for you.  Soy,and Canola are both now primarily GMO unless it's organic.  If you aren't familiar with GMOs it's a good time to learn about them and decide for yourself if it's something you want to consume.  I'm not here to tell you one way or another but I've made the decision to avoid it as much as possible.And regarding ""Natural Flavors"".  What I have heard is ""Natural Flavors"" is industry term ingredients which can contain MSG and / or Aspartame.Just doing a bit of research on the ingredient list of this bar, I can't see how Think Thin can get away with calling itself ""All Natural"".  It really should be called ""Deprived from Natural Ingredients"" or ""What was once natural ingredients but now is in a unrecognizable form"".INGREDIENTS: PROTEIN BLEND (WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE, SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE, CALCIUM CASEINATE, CASEIN), GLYCERIN, COATING (MALTITOL, COCOA BUTTER, CHOCOLATE, SODIUM CASEINATE, MILK FAT, SOY LECITHIN, NATURAL FLAVORS, SALT), MALTITOL, ALKALIZED COCOA, COCOA SOY CRISPS (SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE, ALKALIZED COCOA, TAPIOCA STARCH), PEANUTS, WATER, CANOLA OIL, NATURAL FLAVORS, SOY LECITHIN, COFFEE.CONTAINS: MILK, PEANUTS, SOY.MANUFACTURED IN A PLANT THAT ALSO PROCESSES EGGS AND TREE NUTS.GLUTEN FREE Certified Gluten Free by GFCO, gfco.orgMaltitol is a sugar alcohol and is artificially produced (according to various sources).Sodium caseinate is the biochemical name for casein. Casein is the name for a family of related phosphoproteins . These proteins are commonly found in milk.For 230 calories a bar and 20 grams of protein I think a person could do better for their body and have something tastier to eat.  Perhaps a few eggs?",1.0

I am trying to isolate any other potential variables and will try to stick with it (since I have 4 boxes left!) but I am disappointed.

6322,My Favorite Treat,"This macaroni & cheese is heavenly. Even people who are not gluten intolerant love it at our house. I add nothing to it but a bit of extra butter, and we are very happy with it. Makes being gluten-free pretty darned easy.Our only complaint (why I didn't give it five stars) is there just doesn't seem to be much here for the price. Kraft boxes are over 7 ounces (these are six) and the cost is well over double for the gluten-free. It takes several boxes to feed a family, or at least two if you have little portions...which we don't :-)",4.0
565,Poor quality tea full of sharp hay-like bitter stems,"I bought this on a lightning deal and am very disappointed. If you want (bagged) high quality chamomile tea, stick to all-flowers, high-quality potent Traditional Medicinals brand. This produced-going by their exact instructions and a couple of variations-a browner tea than pure chamomile flowers produce (darker in this case does NOT mean potent-chamomile is golden and it should only ever become a more saturated yellow if steeped at rich concentrations, never even approaching brown or apple cider type coloration), and just as crucially it tasted more twiggy and was far less aromatic with nearly none of the sweet apple-cherimoya tastes than any good chamomile.While I do tend to brew loose tea&am; picky about the actual bags used by any given brand (chemical bleaching will destroy all tea), bags are nearly essential when my time to get tea is limited to pouring water over the tea and covering it to steep at my work area and another ten seconds to squeeze the bag out and toss the tea. Still, I won't be taking this anywhere-the two unused boxes will go to a food bank since I'm sure someone will appreciate it if only as something hot and free of caffeine. Frankly, Celestial Seasonings makes tea better than the two Alvita single-ingredient options I purchased.One thing I tend to do with every new tea  try is analyze the actual tea itself, always wet but often dry as well. This one's prominence of stems (a 1.5cm one punctured the bag in pushing out the liquid with a spoon against the little ramekin lid I cover my cups with), the dusty brown flecks of what I presume are chamomile flowers-very poorly handled ones!-and the end result leave me writing a review urging you to go elsewhere. If you want bagged tea, Traditional Medicinals' chamomile--which is all flower, twice as flavor (and nutrient)-rich as Alvita gram for gram, and can be steeped essentially indefinitely(til the bag breaks down) without becoming bitter, which is true of nearly all pure chamomile(that isn't treated with pesticides or in treated bags etc), especially Egyptian varieties-- is so far the best I've found. Two bags of this cannot compete with ONE of theirs and if you steep Alvita beyond a few minutes your tea will be bitter and woody-tannins and other bitter components are from the stems, not the flower.If you are able and willing to do the extra minute of work, getting loose WHOLE Egyptian chamomile flowers whose quality you can visibly assess (including how long they've been sitting around) is by far your best bet-cheapest, too, and a Chinese tea gallery can sell you a cute little handled double-layer mesh strainer for a few dollars-I personally use my Pyrex measuring cups to steep so I can easily pour the golden (in this case-iodine red or kiwi green or whatever other shade it turns out) liquid into my drinking vessel and if the ingredients are suited to multiple steepings like oolong or pu'ehr steep again without too much awkwardness.The tl;dr essence of this: look elsewhere-this is extremely poor chamomile, whether you ask me, a diligent grower, or an expert-this is not advertised as twiggy tea (it'd be the wrong component anyway) and you likely aren't looking for an infusion from taking boiling water to hay-like splintery stems. For shame, Alvita. For shame.Try this instead: [[B0009F3PM6:Traditional Medicinals Organic,Chamomile, 16-Count Boxes(Pack of 6)]]You won't regret it.",1.0

The coffe is not the normal rich tasting wonderfull smelling JBM I have had before, it just tastes like every other coffee albeit at an extravagent price.

183,"Not for everyone, especially me.","The product description says that this tea is 'slightly sweet' as well as a bunch of other descriptors, but I didn't get any sweetness at all. I was very optimistic because I normally love everything Tazo offers, but this time I had my hopes dashed.I brewed up a mug of this tea and was immediately alarmed at the bouquet. The teabag smelled different, but once the hot water hit it the smell seemed to really magnify. But I scooped in a few teaspoons of sugar and hoped for the best. I managed to choke down about a third of the cup before I called it a day. Life is too short to drink something you don't like.However, I had read a review that mentioned how good and palatable this tea was when combined with the Tazo Lotus. I figured it was worth a shot, otherwise I'd have to throw out this tea altogether.The Lotus smelled great, so I was excited. I blended the two bags (one Lotus and one Wild Sweet Orange) in a large mug, then removed the Wild Sweet Orange after a minute. I left the Lotus in for another minute or two (yeah, definitely two).The result was a very unusual, but not unappealing, beverage. Would I drink this more than once a day? No. Was it very interesting and something that I'll try again? Yes.Live and learn, I guess.",2.0

9238,Organic Mesa Sunrise is awesome!,"We love this cereal, both parents, child and toddler!  Unlike many other Gluten Free cereals, it contains a bit more fiber; which if you are Celiac you understand why I mention that!  The fiber content is not overly high, so I would gather that it has more to do with the flax.  It is a good crispy cereal with a fairly mild flavor, which is slightly sweet.  The one peculiar thing is that even though it tastes great, the smell is not as pleasant as the taste.  This is also likely because of the flax.  And if it gets past the expiration date, you will know it... nasty odor!  That said, it is probably the best organic, gluten free cereal we have found that has more nutritional value.

The garlic is what I was really hoping for, but it wasn't a very discernible flavor in my bowl.

The vegetables did come out a little on the mushy side when I had it, microwaved at 3 minutes in a 1000-watt unit (the directions recommend 2-4 minutes), while the penne was just a little firm but in better shape than the veggies. The chicken doesn't look incredibly appetizing (it looks like it's been sitting in some broth in a can, frankly), but it tasted fine and the texture was normal. Overall it was a decent-tasting soup and it did its job of filling me up; you gotta love Progresso and the ridiculous amount of food they can fit into these cans. The broth did leave an unpleasantly-firm ring of color around the bowl as I continued eating.

I bought the whole case with the intention of enjoying some myself and giving some as presents.  The reviews were so positive, and I thought the vanilla would have to make it wonderful no matter what.  But, I was wrong.  To my taste, this tea is awful.  It's nearly tasteless (which I do not consider a benefit in tea), but what I did taste wasn't very nice.  After one cup, I threw away the box I'd opened and put the unopened boxes where people could take them if they wanted.  I wouldn't have given it to anyone as a gift.",1.0

Coffee mate is perfect because it does the job very effectively and it has a nice taste as well.  This is a good option for the lactose intolerant.The subscribe and save option brings the price down to 5.35, which I think is probably the cheapest for a container this size.There are certain things that I feel should be considered for people drinking this stuff.....One teaspoon has about 10 calories so if you are like me who puts a table spoon that is 30 calories. I mentioned this because I drink 3 cups of coffee every day- the calories can add up pretty fast.Coffee mate also contains trans fats - one of the ingredients is Mono- and diglycerides - these are agents used to extend the shelf life and we also see them in foods which have trans fats, which have been bad. It also contains hydrogenated fats which is linked to heart disease. Incidentally the European version is sold without this ingredient.Enjoy responsibly.Source: http://www.organicauthority.com/health/what-the-heck-is-coffee-mate-creamer.htmlhttp://www.cspinet.org/",5.0

759,"Toothsome condiment, absurdly overpriced.","This substance is quite a bit like Vegemite (one reviewer here makes a point that it's not: I'm not sure he tasted both, otherwise why make such an obviously absurd statement? Vegemite is a tad smoother, but that's all).The consistency and colour are a bit like chocolate mousse but much thicker. It is a bit softer than Vegemite though. The predominant flavour is salty, with a noticeable aftertaste of bitter, and a hint of smoke and beer. Ignore the promotions that suggest it's a spread: it is most certainly not a spread -- if you spread it on a slice of bread like jam or butter, you'll vomit: it's too bitter in such a huge quantity. Better do this: spread some nice butter on your bread, generous amount, and then add no more than quarter teaspoon of this thing. You don't have to spread it: me, I just scoop it from the bottle and eat. Take a bite out of your bread, and then 1/4 tsp of Marmite directly off the spoon. Or you can try to spread it, but it's thicker than butter and it'll be hard to smother it evenly over butter, it'll clump and remain in one place (too much of it). A small amount does it, don't gorge, it's a strong flavour. It also works great with zesty greens, like arugula, for example. Well, there isn't much else to say: it's great stuff, and I can heartily recommend it.Don't listen too much to the talk of its being an ""acquired taste"", only for the Brits, etc. It's a normal condiment that all people will like, I believe. Which brings me to one very significant moment: it's absurdly overpriced. I would put it in the same category as, say, soy sauce, or salsa, and it should cost about the same too.Btw, don't get it here, get it locally: it's a bit more expensive but there's no shipping, so the overall cost will be much lower. I get it in Whole Foods, for the obscene seven/forty-nine a small jar (but it's less than overall here though), or, when they have it (not always), at Wegman's, for the less-unreasonable four/ninety-nine. Good stuff, but needs to be much cheaper, when will Unilever come to their senses? I think a fair price for Marmite would be like, say, three dollars for 250 grams (and it shouldn't be sold in such small jars either: 250 grams is the smallest that'd make sense, 'cause like it is, I finish it off, alone, in less than two days and have to go buy another jar). In my view, Marmite should come in 250 gram, half a kilo, and a kilo packages -- and cost a fraction of what it costs right now. It's even more expensive than Vegemite (who is available at Wegman's, for about six bucks at the time of posting). These two similar products are quite agreeable, but six to eight bucks a tiny jar is way too much, it's an insolence really. I can't give good rating to this product in view of these prices, therefore: product itself is five stars; prices one star: our overall rating here is therefore three stars.",3.0

3032,Filtered Buckwheat...,"For pollen in honey refer to the link provided in the comment section. Buckwheat Honey when raw, has more nutrients since it is unpasteurized and not force filtered, to deliver the highest possible levels of enzymes, vitamins and minerals. Raw honey tastes different than filtered or process honey but more importantly majority of raw honey are in solid form not liquid unless you apply heat or do not store properly. Dutch Gold is not raw, it is filtered and although it tastes like buckwheat since it is from buckwheat flower, an acquired taste, processing takes out the nutrients and that is why it is not in a solid form but liquid form. Dutch Gold is more reputable company than most regardless. Raw Tupelo honey is in liquid form, rare but that is how Tupelo is but Buckwheat in solid form.REAL HONEY: Raw honey is expensive. USDA organic honey is more expensive than just even organic honey without the stamp of USDA. To combine RAW and USDA organic and add qualities like Only 100% pure raw, unpasteurized, unfiltered, undiluted, untreated, unprocessed, no HFCS, not adulterate, not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup, makes it the true honey not glucose tasting like honey. For that reason that superior product, that superior superfood never sells in big buckets, or hardly ever in any container over 16 oz jar.FILTERING: At country's top honey packers, Dutch Gold, in Lancaster, PA, raw honey gets pumped through layers of white filters. Before the honey hit the filters, a powdered sedimentary rock called diatomaceous earth is added. This is a standard, widely used process. It removes all the pollen, along with dust, bees' wings, and, of course, the diatomaceous earth.ORGANIC HONEY: Organic honey doesn't go through nearly as fine a filter since organic rules prohibit the use of diatomaceous earth in the filtering process but regardless it is not a raw honey just because organic.VARIETY: Weather, location, flower type and season impact the coloring, taste and viscosity of honey produced by bees. Honey by the cost will hardly even crystallize. Tupelo sold by YS is raw although runny and pourable which will not crystallize due to its high moisture content. If from outside of US then Fair Trade stamp has some assurances of fair treatment of workers although not true in every case.CHINESE HONEY: Chinese honey famous for ""ultrapurified,"" a technique that can involve diluting honey with extra water, running it through extremely fine filters, and then removing the water. The process filters out much more and produces a sweet substance that is no longer honey. The process removes any pollens and the possibility of identifying the source of honey. Chinese honey is barred from the U.S. not because it's unsafe, but because U.S. officials decided it was too cheap. Chinese honey has had more than its share of safety problems. But there's also plenty of perfectly good Chinese honey for sale on the world market. EU is fussier about honey quality than the US, yet EU imports lots of honey from China but not US.QUALITY: A honey is only as good as the producer and regardless of all marketing and claims by sellers, there is no assurance that a jar of honey is full of pollen, unheated or unfiltered at 100 degree instead of 130 degree. Even if the honey was heated only to 90 degree at the time of production, the honey jar could be sitting in a storage or while being transported in containers that the temperatures can easily exceed 100 degrees. The only assurance that I have is purchasing honey from a producer with high quality reputation and a seller with high turnover. Wedderspoon brand and New Zealand are on top of my list. Purchasing Wedderspoon directly from Wedderspoon or authorized distributor is the only assurance I have for proper storage, pollen and enzymes that honey is consumed for.USES: I consume honey not by labeling but by the amount of pollen it carries. Only 100% pure raw, unpasteurized, unfiltered, undiluted, untreated, unprocessed, no HFCS, not adulterate, not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup from only trusted brands. I consume honey all the time since it has many nutritional benefits for me. I consume after any meal since it helps digestion. I used to consume chocolate years ago but I do not anymore since I consume pure cocoa which I add to my power drinks. I am into many sports and quality honey is the best quick energy I can get to boost my immune system and give myself a healthy rush of energy when I am in middle of my mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, surfing, etc. I drink lots of tea and I never use honey instead I use molasses. Molasses does not lose its nutritional value when heated but any heat to raw honey kills the quality enzymes and pollen in honey so I only consume honey straight out of the jar with spoon in moderation due to its high calories. Honey is the best ointment for all my scabs in mountain biking trails. After a day when my wounds are sealed I place raw honey for rejuvenation and it is the best healer of all instead of using Neosporin which loosens the scab and removes the scab, leaving scars on my skin. Honey helps kill the bacteria that may cause infection. When honey comes into contact with damaged skin, it triggers the production of antibacterial hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, the sugars in honey mean there is little space for water molecules (bacteria need water to survive, so reducing the amount available makes it hard for them to thrive). Dabbing on honey or a sprinkling of sugar can deprive the bacteria of water, which ultimately destroys them. Bravo.",3.0

Some are better than others, of course, but I find this particular flavor really, really unpleasant, which is odd given my love for most of the spices listed on label.  The problem is that the clove just overwhelms everything and that's about all I could taste, outside a touch of cinnamon. IMO, clove has much too strong a taste to be used beyond sparingly...in anything. Perhaps adding milk and sugar might've made it more palatable - might even be the way it's 'supposed' to be prepared, but one of the reasons I drink tea is to stay away from having to add sweeteners or milk to make it taste good. In any case, I can't imagine using enough milk/sweetener to subdue the overwhelming clove taste would leave any room in the mug for tea or water.",2.0

It's extremely versatile and mixes well with cereal and oatmeal like all Enfamil/Enfagrow formulas.Like All Enfamil formulas It has extra DHA and Iron vitamins and helps support better growth, brain & eye development as well as immune system development. So your baby won't be losing out on any of the great essential vitamins and minerals needed for healthy development.Enfamil A.R. Baby Formula Milk-Based with Iron, Combo Pack, comes with 1 full 22.2 oz tub of formula as well as 3 boxes of 16.6 oz two pack refills (which easily slip into the tub once empty) . This saves you so much money because buying the tub or cans by themselves can range from 25-28 dollars each.  I would definitely recommend this formula combo pack to anyone with a special little baby.",5.0

My friend bought it too, I smelled her on her skin and in the tube and same thing, yuck.The moisturizing properties are meek, at their best. This is not really for mature skin, I had to reapply repeatedly and it felt my hands feeling clammy and stinking of baby food and I'm only twenty six. I adore this line for all their other products, the shampoos are amazing and the scrub works well but this one item is not the best to sample. I would suggest testing it in the store to see if one can handle it before shelling out some bucks on it.

It has an orange spice taste up front like the only flavored tea around when I was a kid, didn't like it then, don't like it now.  Then it finishes with a Stevia after taste!  Yuck.  I like my teas plain and would prefer to add my own sweetener if I feel it's needed.  This is a miss in my book and it's not surprising when the ingredients list 'natural orange flavor' before 'natural blueberry flavor' in the line up.  Why not something more natural like actual blueberry? Right? Silly me. It doesn't taste like a berry of any kind by my standards. So, if berry and green tea are the taste you're looking for AND you like the multifaceted herbal taste of Yogi brand teas then try their Goji Berry instead, it's wonderful w/ no weird sweetener after taste and no orange spice! Goji Berry is 5 stars in my book!",2.0

8041,There's not enough Pie in this faux Pumpkin spice mix,"For the Holidays last year, I decided to forgo the legitimate Pumpkin Pie and try something a bit lighter/healthier. I'm familiar with Jell-O's No Bake line, such as their delicious No Bake cheesecake, so I figured their Pumpkin Pie (style) mix should be good too. Well, it's not. At first taste, I thought ""that's not bad!"", but after a few mouthfuls of it, I could barely stand it anymore. There are two main problems I find with it. First of all, the consistency is off, it doesn't really get to a Pie consistency, more like pudding as another reviewer mentioned. I've added less milk (1.5 cups) and that helped a bit with the texture (now more like thicker pudding). Second, in order to compensate for the lack of any real Pumpkin, Kraft put wayy too much ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg or whatever else in there. The pumpkin spice flavor is overly pronounced and upsets my stomach after a few spoonfuls. So now I'm stuck with a few boxes of this stuff trying to figure out how to use it and/or get rid of it.  At the very least, I could use the included crust mixes for another one of Jell-O's better flavors.",2.0
5680,I Really Wanted to Like this Tea :-(,"I love all kinds of teas, I drink some every day.  I saw that so many people like this blueberry variety, so I decided to try it.  I am a big believer in the ""groupthink"" of customer reviews.  And I am rarely disappointed in anything Amazon.  I didn't see that stevia is an ingredient.  Stevia creates a very bitter taste in my mouth.  So I will be sharing this shipment with my friends who don't mind stevia.  I'm going to look at other Yogi teas and check on the ingredients closely.",2.0
3316,You should know before purchasing...,"-- That the color of the egg product suffers a bit from being dried.I have uploaded some Product Images to illustrate.The images show 3 bowls:One with Honeyville Farms powder (HV)One with straight dry yolk powder from another vendor (Y) and...One with a fresh large egg (FRESH)The images pretty fairly represent the color issue -- the dry and mixed powders both are duller and browner than the fresh egg.The mixed powders were blended with bottled water as per the label directions, and allowed to stand for several minutes to fully hydrate.A third image shows a batch of scrambled eggs made from the illustrated egg products, with additional seasoning, dairy, spices and garnish. The eggs tasted fine, and looked OK, when lightened with dairy and camouflaged with chives, paprika and butter.What wouldn't?So if you are using the egg powder in dishes where the color is not particularly important, this product should be fine. But if you are depending on the bright cheery yellow of a fresh egg yolk, as in scrambled eggs or an omelet, you should probably stick to fresh. Or use camouflage, like Honeyville did on their package picture.",4.0

This in one of those teas where you wrap your hands around the mug to warm up and savor the smell & taste.

The pretzels are fine, the sweetened cereal pieces are very good, and those swirls...goodness, those swirls!  I open a bag and immediately start hunting down those swirls!

4703,"Impressive Cup of Tea, Could Be Helpful with Women's Health Issues","*****This Woman's Dong Quai Tonic from Yogi Tea is for hormone balance. I'm pretty finicky with my tea tastes and I like it. It has an herby and slightly spicy, slightly sweet taste to it that makes it a pleasure to drink. I usually brew two bags in one cup, which is recommended on the package for overall health and fatigue relief. It is stronger that way, and more intense of an experience, although it still tastes great with just one bag. I'd been having lots of hot flashes and wanted to get down to business with this tea.Woman's Dong Quai Tonic comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh) and is organic.The ingredients in Woman's Dong Quai Tonic are: dong quai root extract, juniper berry extract, and a proprietary blend of herbs, including all organic: cinnamon bark, orange peel, ginger root, fennel seed, chamomile flower, dandelion root, anise seed, stinging nettle leaf, dong quai root (I guess as opposed to the extract), black pepper, and orange oil. Amazingly, I can taste some of these, like the chamomile, and the anise seed and the ginger, making for a lovely and complex cup of tea. I'm impressed!Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Organic Woman's Dong Quai Tonic is an effective and organic way to lessen fatigue, restore your energy and balance a woman's hormones. This healing tonic is formulated to ease what traditional Chinese medicine practitioners refer to as ""blood deficiency,"" resulting from stress, poor digestion, or improper eating and health habits. We've included in our tonic the potent ""Queen of Herbs"" Dong Quai (Angelica sinensis), shown to be effective in supporting the reproductive organs, addressing common female hormone imbalances, helping to regulate the menstrual cycle and building all-around health. Bartram's Encyclopedia of Herbal Medicine (1995) indicates Dong Quai is useful for a wide range of female conditions, including minor symptoms of PMS (such as mild mood changes) and menopause (such as hot flashes). This powerful herb is complemented by Organic Nettle to help detox your body, as well as Organic Dandelion Root and Juniper Berry to help maintain proper water balance. According to yogic wisdom, women have greater emotional awareness and intuitive powers. A woman can choose to be balanced, happy and healthy. Choose to drink a daily cup of Woman's Dong Quai Tonic and feel like your healthy, beautiful, graceful self."" I don't know about that, but I do like the tea, and it seems like it might be helping with my hot flashes (I've been having fewer...whether or not it's due to the tea, I don't know!), which is why I bought it---for menopausal support.There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.Highly recommended.*****",5.0

To be clear, the tea was all right, but rather underwhelming for this ginger lover.",3.0

6124,Not the house favorite,"I have to say, after trying this and reading the reviews, I thought this would be great.  Well, it was definitely a thumbs down in this house, everyone included.  When you're asked not to buy something again, I guess that says everything.  They even thought that the local grocery store's knockoff brand was better than this.  It's just not very creamy, you have to chop up the chunks of cheese in it, and it just takes awhile to mix it in. Then, the noodles are chewy.  It's cute for Easter if you have little ones, but other than that, I wouldn't recommend it.",3.0

7117,Great if you like sugar and don't mind partially hydrogenated oils,"These are quite tasty if you like sugar or sweets (I do), but they contain partially hydrogenated oil. For taste alone, I would give these 5 stars for people who like sweets. For people who want a healthy snack, I wouldn't recommend these. Overall I am giving it 3 stars because while these may taste good, it's only due to being very sweet due to lots of sugar and corn syrup. Also, while the impression may be that these are good for you being only 90 calories (it's only a .8 ounce bar anyway), I certainly wouldn't say they are. They also contain artificial flavors.",3.0

7691,Tasty if not very spicy,"I was hoping these noodles would have a little more kick than they did, but aside from being not as hot as I'd like, they're pretty tasty. I ended up adding some crushed red pepper flakes and that helped a bunch. Adding some scallions, mushrooms, and shrimp or chicken turns them into a nice meal. The noodles cook well but are only average in the flavor department. They won't make you feel like you got carry-out from your favorite Chinese place, but they're not awful either.Not the best Chow Mein you can get, but easy to make, and even easier to add your own fresh ingredients to, so all-in-all not a bad quick meal.",3.0
1824,"Average chocolate, strong fillings","These are definitely ""mid-range"" chocolates, not quite as good as Godiva or See's. If you're used to low-end chocolates like Fannie May or Russell Stover, you'll probably find these to be very good. However, if you're used to very good chocolates like La Maison du Chocolat, you'll be sorely disappointed.I found the chocolate to have unexceptional flavor and a somewhat waxy texture. The fillings were mostly very sweet or alcoholic, which is a common practice to cover up mediocre chocolate.I guess they're a good value compared to Godiva, although I think See's Candies has an even better value. Don't expect Leonidas to compare to a high-end chocolatier.",3.0

The ""Original"" blend is the one that has the best flavors, NOT the ""Table"" Blend.The service is very good, however, so would shop here again.",4.0
4962,Can never get to the noodles...,"While I like that this is low sodium and kind of handy on the go, I've had to learn a few things the hard way with this product:Definitely hold it upside down and shake it up a lot before you microwave it, otherwise the carrots will revolt and explode at the bottom and tip the whole cup over, spilling all the product all over your microwave.  Not fun to clean up, especially at work with everyone laughing at you.No matter how hard you try, all you will get while sipping through the cup is broth and maybe 7-10 mini round noodles.  All the rest retreat to the bottom of the cup and stay there so you have to pop off the top and scoop out the noodles with a spoon.  Which completely defeats the purpose of this being an on-the-go product.If you're really lazy but still want those noodles, cover the little hole at the top of the sippy cup, tilt it fully vertical over your head, and while holding the larger hole on the cup over your mouth give a few good whacks to the bottom which will dislodge the stubborn noodles at the bottom and move them closer to the top.  You'll still only get about 10 more noodles but it makes you feel like you've succeeded at something while trying to eat lunch.Probably won't buy these again unless I'm getting something that doesn't have the noodles in it.  Just seems too wasteful to me.",3.0

4980,So-so product; nothing mind-blowing,"After a disastrous run-in withMiracle Noodle Shirataki Fettuccini, 7-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6), I decided to try these ""tofu shirataki"" noodles, which supposedly have a slightly better texture than straight up shirataki.Once again, as with user reviews regarding the aforementioned Miracle Noodles, I am really mystified by all the histrionic reports of a ""bad"", fishy smell. This is the second time I've opened a shirataki noodle package expecting to be knocked back by a horrible smell, only to smell nothing but a mild odor reminiscent of some soy-based product.As for the noodles themselves, the texture didn't have that strange ""cartilage-like"" feel of fettucine-style Miracle Noodles. However, they were very rubbery and stretchy, requiring a lot of chewing. Personally, I found nothing offensive about this texture but those expecting it to have the consistency of spaghetti might find themselves disgusted or just plain disappointed by it, since these are being touted as a substitute for pasta.Flavor-wise, these noodles have none. This poses a huge problem for those hoping to turn to them to ""lose weight."" This becomes all too apparent when you come across recipes from other users for this product. More often than not, the recipes often call for rich, fattening sauces; meats, fish, seafood; and other ingredients that usually bump up the calories a hundred-fold. (One recipe I saw-- kid you not-- involved fried pork sausage!}Why do recipes for shirataki noodles tend to go overboard? Well, since they have no flavor, you can't just boil them up as you would other noodles and eat them with a basic soup base or sauce. You have to literally drown them in tons of other stuff to make them filling. So whatever health benefits you gain by substituting carbs with these shirataki noodles is canceled out by the calories and sodium you wind up tacking on from the sauces and other junk you have to add to make them ""work.""All in all, a ""so-so"" product-- not bad, not great. Adventurous chefs and eaters who like to try new things may get a kick out of them, because of the interesting texture and cooking challenge they pose. Dieters on the other hand may want to steer clear. Because these noodles have no taste, they'll find themselves needing to add so many ingredients that they may as well just be cooking a ""regular"" meal with these as nothing more than a side dish. In addition, this product isn't necessarily the best substitute for pasta, because the texture couldn't be more different. Three stars.",3.0

9998,Teabags are not individually wrapped,"I'm somewhat disappointed the teabags are in little pouches of each flavor that cannot be resealed.

The Peppermint is strong and gives that minty tingle when you drink it. Sleepytime is also good, a milder mint flavor than the peppermint with a hint of other undefinable flavors. My box did not have Wild Berry Zinger - it contained Honey Vanilla Chamomile instead. I found it to have a smooth, sweet taste but I wish it was just honey, vanilla, and chamomile without the other ingredients for a purer taste. Lemon Zinger is a bit strong for my tastes but that's my personal opinion; I'm sure many will like it. The surprise of the bunch was Chamomile. One of my favorite teas, it's always a safe choice when trying teas. However, this had a slightly 'off' flavor and smell I've never encountered with chamomile teas before. It isn't horrible but it just doesn't taste right to me. Still, this is a good variety and a great way to try out this brand of tea.",3.0

5485,"Nice and strong, but not my favorite blend of Irish Breakfast","I love Irish Breakfast blend teas. For me, the stronger the better. I don't take my tea with with anything, no sugar or milk for me. Black teas are my coffee, and an Irish Breakfast is my morning cup of Folgers. With that said, this blend is alright. I bought quite a few boxes of it and have been drinking them every day for about a month now. I drink a LOT of tea, probably around 10-14 mugs/glasses a day. This tea I can only take about one glass of before I'm ready for something else. It's just not as good as a few others I have had. My favorite beingHarney & Sons Fine Teas Irish Breakfast. Not too sure what the major difference is in this blend over all the others I've enjoyed, but there definitively is one. Not planning on buying any more of this kind after I've gone through the rest of the boxes.",3.0
5427,Try through gradual introduction and mixing to see whether this soy-based formula will cause constipation,"Be careful to introduce this soy formula gradually.  If a baby is put on it exclusively, perhaps in an effort to avoid colic-related pain, the result will likely be painful constipation.  Soy-based formula is highly identified with constipation, although some children don't have a better choice.The formulas that break milk down to a level for a baby's tummy to process it are all significantly more expensive.  This all comes down to a matter of money, and it is stressful for parents that can't afford the premium offered by each major brand.Therefore, go easy and slowly as a percentage of the formula your baby eats and eventually see if baby can consume this soy formula without the constipation.  It's worth a try.  Constipated babies will cry with all their might though.",3.0
4991,"If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.","I very much wanted to like tofu shirataki noodles. Unfortunately, they are just a little too unusual for my taste. They're not awful, but the texture is very slippery and chewy. As was mentioned in other reviews, even after rinsing and soaking they still have a distinctive smell and taste. A sesame-soy based sauce seems to compliment the shirataki noodles best. (i.e., masks the taste) Spaghetti sauce just doesn't taste right with it. Since this product is not available locally and has to be shipped from New York to Texas at a net cost of about $5 a package, I would be very unlikely to purchase it again.",3.0
5905,Jessica Is Laughing All the Way to The Bank...,"I noticed Jessica Alba promoting ZICO while taking credit as a well behaved, caring parent who had many health issues when she was a child and now how proud she is being part of these fine companies including ZICO (meaning she shares the profit of the sales). Let's look at some facts on ZICO;1. INGREDIENT: all natural coconut water. Ask yourself, have you ever seen a natural food item, any food item even a coconut water when you crack a fresh coconut, where the natural water of that coconut to last for months in any temperature. No it will not last more than few hours so why is it that Jessica is not disclosing the preservatives that are included inside ZICO cartons and bottles when infact you will get no preservatives when cracking a fresh coconut and drinking the coconut juice for a dollar a coconut instead of four dollars for ZICO. With fresh coconut you will even end up with fresh coconut meat as well,,2. HYDRATE: hydration requires consuming water at zero calories, not sugar. You can drink all the coconut juices in the world and it still will not hydrate unless you drink water. Sugar will force you to drink water so you will have to consume water after drinking ZICO,3. HAND HARVEST COCONUTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD: meaning not a Fair Trade certified product. Meaning ZICO is the same as Coco Cola, the same as the competition without Fair Trade certification,4. AS MUCH POTASSIUM AS A SMALL BANANA: Let' compare based on NUTRITION FACTS. For a cup comparison although not the same since we are comparing liquid with solid, but regardless ZICO vs. banana in calories 50/33, potassium 360/317, sugar 10/2.4 and tall of that not considering where banana offers 3.7mg of Phytosterols in lowering cholesterol, all other vitamins and minerals from 171% vitamin C, A, K, B6, fiber, and all minerals where ZICO offers none other than sugar in a processed container.It is fine to consume a processed food or drink if one wishes to do so but for Jessica Alba is purely misleading public while acting as a caring individual. ZICO is a processed drink in a carton, which has a whopping 40gr of sugar processed just like other coconut water brands, like Coca-Cola, not a Fair Trade product which has nothing to do with hydration or banana. I drink coconut water by cracking cold coconuts that I keep in my refrigerator and understand the nutritional value of each when a fresh coconut costs me a dollar, a banana twenty five cents not four dollars for a processed coconut in container with preservative.",1.0

It is not as good as fleur de sel or some of the other ""gourmet"" salts, but it is only 15 cents per ounce, not 15 dollars.  Note that this salt is flaked, unlike the normal crystals for which Diamond Salt is known.  It absolutely CLINGS to the surface of the popcorn, fries, and other similarly-textured foods MUCH better.  It has a cleaner taste than some of the brown or grey sea salts and CLEAN is always good in my book.As a treat, I sometimes Iick the tip of my index finger, sprinkle a little of this on it, and then pretend like I'm getting ready to do a mini tequilla shooter, but without the lime.  Almost like a couple of hours on the beach.I can only give it four stars instead of five because it is NOT IODIZED and you could end  up looking just like a frog with big goiter things on your neck if you don't get enough iodine.

507,Thumper Rabbit RIP,"**Former Child Star Thumper Meets Tragic End**The mystery of the disappearance of Thumper, on par with that of Judge Crater and Jimmy Hoffa, came to a shocking end yesterday when a gory photograph of the famous actor was posted on the Amazon web site.Clues in the photograph, showing Thumper's headless and trussed body, led California Private Investigator, Edward ""Eddie"" Valiant to the Cloverdale processing plant where Thumper's long and fabled life had evidently ended.""Who would do such a dastardly thing to my uncle?""  sobbed  family spokesman Roger Rabbit, who is Thumper's nephew and also a known Hollywood actor, at the mobbed press conference held hours after the gristly discovery. ""If I hadn't hired Eddie Valiant to get the job done, the cops would still have their heads down a rabbit hole!"" and ""Where the %@*& is my uncle's head?""Born Oscar Q Rabbit to a theatrical family of animated characters specializing in animal roles, Rabbit was hired by the Disney Studios when just a tiny bunny. Nicknamed ""Thumper"" for an endearing but nervous twitch of the left hind foot, he eventually became known throughout the world by that single name, joining the exclusive rank of one named stars such as Cher, Madonna and Pele.Cast as a child character in a small supporting role in the movie Bambi in 1942, Thumper's adorable and enduring persona lit the screen with a charisma way beyond that of a humble sidekick.A memorable line in Bambi became the touchstone of Thumper's life. ""If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all!"" formed the basis of what is now known as ""The Thumperian Principle"" . Grown to a world movement, Thumperian disciples believe in the tenant that bad grammar and good deeds are cosmically linked.Thumper continued work at the Disney Studios with Thumper2 and Thumper Goes Exploring but was eventually released from his contract when as a young adult, despite desperate efforts, he could not control the twitch in his hind leg. Rumors of drug abuse were never proven although Thumper spent several months at a private hospital for reported exhaustion  after completing the filming Thumper Goes Exploring.Never making the transition to television as did his younger relatives, Crusader Rabbit and Bugs Bunny, Thumper's career floundered until he was reduced to starring in three rabbitsploitation movies, ""Suck My Carrot"", ""Young Bunny Coed Love"", and finally, ""The Bunny Hole"".A long time alcoholic and well known visitor to the watering holes along the Sunset Strip and Las Vegas, Thumper lent his name to what has become a popular drinking game.Thumper spent his final years prior to his disappearance making celebrity appearances at Bambi reunions and Thumperian conferences and spent two seasons on Hollywood Squares where the muffled thumping of his hind led could often be heard in the background.Thumper was the founder and president of the ""Shake A Leg Foundation"" a research and charitable organization for rabbits and other small mammals suffering from hind leg movement disorder. Contributions to the foundation can be made in his name.Thumper is survived by his older brother, Benjamin Bunny, his nephew, Roger Rabbit, and his fourth wife, Jessica Rabbit and 974 children.",3.0

2079,Average,"I expected a lot from these beans after reading some of the reviews here on Amazon. I expected a rich, flavorful espresso bean. These beans appear to be under roasted. They are very light in appearance and don't have any of the customary oil that I find thinly coating other quality coffee beans. I still gave them a try, and the resulting brew did taste better than expected, but was nothing to write home about. They do make a very nice cup of regular coffee if ground using the 'course' setting of my bur grinder. I've decided to just use them for coffee as they make a pleasing cup of moderately strong coffee if you use enough beans. I use approximately twice as many beans as I do with the 100% Kona that is my usual bean to get coffee that tastes substantial. These beans also cost half as much as the Kono beans do, so I guess that's tolerable.I would not recommend these for Espresso. For normal coffee they're fine, but still not in any way remarkable.",3.0

Others have said the same in their reviews, but I ignored them to my chagrin. It is very very thin and has a texture and appearance like it has been reconstituted and highly processed. Because it is so thin, there are never any big lumps of gristle, but sometimes you can tell the meat quality as a bit off in some pieces. The worst problem is the overly sweet flavor, the second problem is the texture and meat quality. This is not a very good jerky. Their Buffalo, while also too sweet, is much better as is their Turkey. They are much much less expensive than a really premium jerky like those from Mountain America, so it is a toss up. For the price, I may re-order the Turkey and perhaps Buffalo, but I will never order this Beef again.",2.0

I'm looking for a lowfat, high-protein snack but if I'm going to add something like jerky to my diet I can't have all the usual chemicals and such.  So, this product is an excellent price and as far as I'm concerned it tastes great, but it's a softer jerky, almost exactly like Pemmican.  Part of the fun with jerky, and why it's such a good snack, as far as I'm concerned, is that it takes awhile to eat it.  THis is easier to eat, but that's not a huge deal, really.Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product.  The ""consume within 3 days of opening"" seems a little odd to me, considering it's a 1 lb. bag.  I keep it in the fridge and it's lasted several weeks without an issue.  Tastes great without all the bad stuff and it doesn't cost an arm & a leg, which is what I was looking for.***UPDATE February 2013***I got the Original and Peppered through subscribe & save every month for over a year, but I recently cancelled.

9680,"Goes well with pastries, but not for everyone","Ah, it's a definitely American story - in 1969 friends Mo Siegel and Wyck Hay of Colorado began selling the herbal teas that they had previously only made for themselves. From such small beginnings came that famous tea company - Celestial Seasonings.Among Celestial Seasonings' many products is Caramel Enchantment Chai Tea. ""Chai"" comes from the Hindi word for tea, but in the West it is interpreted as Masala Chai, Indian spiced tea. This tea is an interesting version of Indian spiced tea, based on black tea, spiced with cinnamon, ginger, cloves, cardamom, nutmeg, black pepper and Chinese star anise.Now, as you might expect from that description, this is a spicy tea. The different spices add up to a unique smell and taste that is not for everyone. Personally, I did not notice a particularly a chocolaty or caramely taste - the cinnamon, ginger and cloves seem to predominate. I added some milk, which helped smooth out the taste, and made for a much more enjoyable drink. Indeed, with the milk, this tea is quite interesting, and goes quite well with pastries.So, if you want to try a fascinatingly different herbal tea, then get Celestial Seasoning's Chocolate Caramel Enchantment Chai tea!",3.0

8469,"Slightly weird taste, minor nutritional improvment","The veggie involved here is dried cauliflower replacing some of the wheat starch in the noodles.  It smells like cauliflower when boiling.  It has a very mild cauliflower taste.In exchange for a slightly unusual taste, the ""veggie"" version of Kraft gives you:Vitamin C 15% daily value (vs. 1% in the regular version)Dietary Fiber 3 grams (vs. 1.5 in the regular stuff)Those were the only notable differences.  An extra 1.5 grams of fiber doesn't seem like a lot, but that's 12% DV instead of 6%.  For other nutrients, such differences matter a lot less.  The veggie version has 1 gram less fat, but that's only 11 calories worth of fat shaved from a food which is already fairly low in fat, and the total calories end up being the same anyway.  There are some 1% differences in some other vitamins, which doesn't matter.Getting back to the taste...Even though there is only a small cauliflower influence on the taste, I found that it somehow did detract from enjoyment.  Blue-box Mac&Cheese; has a very mild cheese flavor, which works OK when the noodles are normal.  But the very slight added cauliflower taste kind of masks the cheese.If you have kids demanding it 3 times per week, a little extra fiber and vitamin C might be a good idea.  But if this is your guilty pleasure food or just a backup plan for rare occasions, I would stick with the normal stuff.If you want to experiment with healthier noodles, there are several brands of dry pasta with omega 3 fats and added fiber.  They do tend to have a wheaty flavor, but on the other hand they don't have that weird cauliflower taste.",3.0

957,ARTIFICIAL TASTING STUFF,"I read another review of this product that stated that this product's first and main ingredient is whey.  Whey is a by-product of milk (remember that little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet eating her curds and whey).  Whey has a somewhat acidic taste that is rather crude.  Cheddar cheese is way down the line in terms of percentage quantity in this stuff.  I couldn't think of what this stuff tasted like until I read the other review.  It's taste does not resemble that of cheddar cheese.  I knew the product had an odd taste which I did not care for.  I just didn't realize what that taste was until I came across the other review.  There are no ingredients listed on the label.  Now I understand why most liked the product.  I assume because they are used to the taste of boxed macaroni and cheese products available in the grocery store with the orange/yellow powder in the packet inside the box.  And most have come to think of that taste as cheese.  Finer tastes however will reject this stuff, I think because it has little cheese.  Cheddar cheese is made with the by products of milk as well.  The big difference is the cultures that are added to produce the various types of cheese.  Plus the aging.  Whey requires no aging or cultures.  Another of the characteristics of whey is that it has little orange/yellow color.  This stuff has food colorings added to produce the appearance you see in the bag.  I read another review where the writer complained about the lack of labeling.  I agree because it is important to most to know what they are consuming.  If you look at the ingredients of some of the other cheese powders you will see cheddar as the first ingredient unlike this stuff.  I believe the reason that this product has no ingredient labeling is to hide that fact.  By regulation ingredients are to be listed in the order of the percentage contained therein.  In other words the first ingredient would be the highest percentage and therefore the last ingredient would be the lowest quantity contained.  I'm not sure what the percentage of cheddar cheese is in this stuff but its way down the line and not the first.  I have tasted other cheese powders with ingredient lists.  Some of best are those with cheese as the first listed ingredient not the 3rd or 4th.  I really don't like the taste of whey powder.  It is crude and acidic.  And that is to me what this stuff tastes like.  I doubt whether I'll buy any more of this.  To each his own taste, though.  I don't purport to know what anyone else prefers.",1.0

7326,Not completely what it seems,"Please note that this is not a review on the taste of the product - it is a review for what I believe would be the majority of people considering the purchase of this product - those intending to go wheat free / gluten free for the health benefits / weight loss etc.  This is not a product that fits.  It's just a trade of one high glycemic index ingredient for others.If your intent is to go gluten free only/specifically - this meets the bill.  If your intent is to go wheat free - in the literal sense, this also meets the bill.  But if your intent is to go wheat free in the sense of the book Wheat Bellies and avoid high glycemic index foods that promote high insulin and fat retention - this is NOT the product to do it.  As indicated in the Wheat Bellies blog ...Wheat raises blood sugar higher than nearly all other foods, including table sugar and many candy bars. The few foods that increase blood sugar higher than even wheat include figs, dates, and other dried fruits, and rice starch, cornstarch, tapioca starch, and potato starch-the most common ingredients used in gluten-free foods. A gluten-free whole grain bread, for instance, is usually made with a combination of brown rice, potato, and tapioca starches. These dried pulverized starches are packed with highly-digestible high-glycemic index carbohydrates and thereby send blood sugar through the roof. This contributes to diabetes, cataracts, arthritis, heart disease and growing belly fat. This is why many celiac patients who forego wheat and resort to gluten-free foods become fat and diabetic. Gluten-free foods as they are currently manufactured are very poor substitutes for wheat flour.I took a look at this product so that I may have some bread - wheat free.  This is not a good substitute.",1.0
3838,Overpriced and overrated,"I purchased these because of the good ratings on Amazon, but was pretty disappointed. First of all, I knew when buying that them these ""truffles"" are not the same kinds of creations that are named truffles by chocolate stores and other chocolate brands. These ""French Truffles"" are actually what I can only describe as soft pieces of chocolate with higher than average cocoa butter content dusted in cocoa.This is not to say that they're bad, which they're not. Plain old chocolate, not the bad-quality kind (like Hersheys), but not the good kind either. I also prefer the types of truffles with a shell and a ganache or other conventional truffle filling inside. And for ~$20, IMO this box of truffles is a bit overpriced and more of a quantity over quality item. This is coming from someone who has tried a LOT of chocolate, some gourmet/small-batch, some mass-produced, and others in the middle (like Godiva). I believe similar, if not identically branded, truffles can also be found in some warehouse stores like Sam's Club, likely at a lower price.In short, I would say that these truffles are probably a bit overrated and at least here on this site, overpriced. They're not that bad, but certainly not worth the price tag. For what you pay after shipping, you might as well go with Godiva or another dependable brand.",3.0
3876,Just nothing special at all.  Underwhelming sauce that boasts miniscule heat and an underwhelming flavor.,"This was my go-to hot sauce back in my High School days.

There's nothing to it.I'd recommend looking into other mild sauces.  There are many others with a comparable burn that have a great deal more flavor.  (I'd recommend Tropical Pepper Co.'s Papaya Curry sauce over this any day of the week, for example.  It has a good flavor for its price and basically the same &#34;burn&#34; value as Frank's RedHot.)  Like Tobasco, this is something that is popular because it's a recognizable brand, despite being of a fairly cheap, low quality.",2.0

The soup is actually decent, and I like sipping the broth after I eat soup so this was why I tried this.  Only takes about 1 minute in the microwave and your good to go.  The only downfall to these cups is that even though I mixed it up good after microwaving, the noodles stay on the bottom once you are done sipping it.  But if I can save these cups and put regular soup in for the future, I guess that would be cool.  But I don't think you can dishwasher these cups.  2 stars for the taste and nothing else.  3 stars less because of price, noodles, and size.",2.0

Before Keurig, I recall a lot of debate in a small office, at the salon, etc.  I decided to try the Butter Toffee because of all the great reviews and because I like Butter Toffee-flavored candies.

To put it bluntly, they're just too greasy and chewy. There are many products of this nature in the same price range that are of far higher quality, so there's really no excuse for making something this poorly.Right out of the bag, they were very greasy to the touch, and left an orange grease on my fingers. The casing and filling seem like wet paper with seasoning, and the filling appeared to be the cheapest ""meat"" you could pull from an animal and still call it meat. I've eaten beef sticks in this same price range that are clearly beef, with much better texture and consistency.These sticks also contain mechanically-separated chicken, which is a pretty disgusting product I try to avoid. Watch some being made sometime, and you'll never eat it again.If you like greasy, spicy meat-stuff in a chewy, paper-like casing, you'll like these.

I love the taste of a solid green tea, however this is anything but. I don't know what exactly went wrong with this blend of green and white, but the final product remains consistant no matter how many times I try to give CS a chance to prove it was just a bad batch I have recieved. The smoothness and slightly sweet flavor is totally gone and you are left with nothing, NOTHING but bitter grass. I am not a particularly picky tea drinker folks, I can tell you of the kind I have had which is better than the others, but I still can find enjoyment in most teas I consume.

Thus, the sodium MUST be coming from some other source than ""vegetable protein from Soybeans and Purified Water"" (ingredients stated on the label). I would prefer it if they were more forthcoming as to how the product is actually made...it's not just soybeans & water...it is vegetable protein DERIVED from soybeans...question is, how do they derive it??Conclusion: Useful, tasty additive to foods, but best used sparingly as you would any other flavoring...probably no better, or worse, than regular soy sauce chemically made from soybeans (which is probably cheaper, but then you don't know where the soybeans come from).I hope this helps anyone who may be as confused as I was!!",3.0

2404,A Conspiracy of Bovine Proportions,"It's all well and good to indulge our creative writing and have a little fun at Amazon's expense, but what do we really know about this so-called Tuscan Milk? I will endeavor to prove that it is neither Tuscan nor milk.Everyone knows nascut (an anagram and almost a backwards spelling exactly of t-u-s-c-a-n) is Romanian for ""born"" (specifically, the past participle of naste). So what we have here is a thinly veiled admission that this liquid has its origins in Eastern, rather than Southern, Europe, and thus offers a flavor more Balkan than Mediterranean. Transylvania to Tuscany is exactly one thousand miles, and allowing for the fact that the earth rotates on its axis one thousand miles per hour, is it any coincidence that Lao Tzu wrote, ""A journey of one thousand miles begins with a single step""?As for the question of color over origin, we are presented with no less of an obvious obfuscation. To be sure, the pictures of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz appear as white as newly fallen arctic snow. But color theory teaches us that white is after all the combined color spectrum.

1467,"Good coffee, but do watch out for differing batches","OK so most people seem to like this coffee; it's got a strong rating (4 1/2 at the moment), but there are still those that say they don't. It will always be subjective; many people detest Starbucks coffee, but millions more like it. Some like it bold, some like it weak, some like it mild, some like it bitter, some like it sweet; no way to please everyone.This coffee is on the mild side, meaning it has flavor but its not overpowering, and is moreso on the sweeter side, meaning it's not bitter like diner-house coffee. The great thing about this flavor is that it blends excellent for those that like to flavor their coffee; because it is not bitter but still has a noticeable coffee flavor, it compliments most flavored creamers. I've had many many different types of coffees with many different types of creamers, and it can be a real balancing act to find the right blends. The senseo medium roast so far has been the best ""starting point"", meaning nobody I've personally made coffee for has said anything but complimentary things about it. Some still like a more bold or bitter coffee, but so far nobody has said poor things about this coffee. I use a single pod in approx. 6oz of coffee in a cheap Hamilton Beach drip machine with filtered water, and it turns out great.One other thing, sometimes batches taste 'slightly' different from one-another; it's a product from a plant when all is said and done, and while controls are put into place to regulate the taste, sometimes batches are slightly more bold or bitter than another, it happens with all manufacturers (including Folgers and other large manufacturers, which I've personally tasted radical variations). I've ordered this 6-pack around 6 times so far, and only one batch was slightly odd tasting (had a much more noticeable/bitter flavor to it), other than that it has been very consistent. I left the bag slightly open on that batch, in essence making it ""go flat"" so it wasn't so bitter. While these packets are sealed, make sure you store them in a sealed container after opening to preserve the flavor.One other thing to watch out for: increasing costs. This pack is still a great deal on Amazon, but I am worried since they have made the decision to pull from retail outlets that it will increase in cost on Amazon as well. I still love this coffee, but if it goes up to $40 for a 6-pack of this, I may be rethinking the coffee I purchase. Keep it low in cost and at the same level of flavor and we'll all be happy.",5.0

The deal is hyssop has antiviral properties. For this reason you should not drink this tea on a regular basis but rather save it for when you get a cold. Hyssop should not be used for extended periods of time and should not be taken by pregnant women as it can cause miscarriage.

8617,Not convinced,"There are now several varieties in the popular Kraft Macaroni and Cheese line.  This is a relatively expensive (per ounce) variety.  The selling point is that it is a healthy option, as the pasta incorporates reconstituted cauliflower.  Like the other varieties, it produces a tasty snack.Macaroni and Cheese (or just 'Macaroni Cheese', as the British say) is actually very easy to make.  You just boil the macaroni until it is soft and there is little water remaining, then add grated cheese, margarine or butter, and a little milk.  Stir it until the mixture has melted and is coating the pasta, and serve.  Black pepper tops it off nicely.  Using these packets is only slightly more convenient and a lot more expensive, plus you are getting heavily processed ingredients.  I'm not convinced that including some dried cauliflower in the pasta really makes it a healthy option.Actually, cauliflower goes very well with Macaroni and Cheese.  Try adding a few florets into the macaroni when you boil it.  Then, whether you add your own sauce ingredients or use these packaged versions, you really will be getting a tastier, more nutritious meal.",3.0
7204,Downright disgusting.,"I am a big fan of Pamela's Products. Their plain shortbread and pecan shortbread are incredible. So I was optimistic about the lemon shortbread cookies, since I'm a fan of everything lemon-flavored. These cookies were a) too sour, b) soggy, without the crumbly, buttery texture of real shortbread and c) they tasted like someone had sprayed Lemon Pledge furniture cleaner on regular shortbread, then sealed it in plastic while damp. Really, they were that gross. Not recommended.",1.0

I am not sure how to describe it . . . perhaps wet lawn clippings or even a mossy taste.

5444,Enfamil Prosobee Soy Infant Formula Powder with Iron,"The first ingredient is corn syrup solids 54%.  This makes my alarms kind of go off because corn syrup is such an addictive product and to be feeding it to babies in such a high amount can make them obese and refuse to take other foods unless they are sweetened.  That said, if your baby is having problems with digestion of lactose or milk proteins, then this product is worth a try.  I will also say that it's not normal to feed a human baby cow's milk but that seems to be what we do.  Breastmilk is by far the best, but that is not always possible, or in the amount needed.  And colicky babies need soothing and therefore I will recommend this product since it does not contain any milk substances and should be easier on your babies digestive system.",3.0

I'm not a huge fan of this specific flavor.Like all of the other Annie Chun products I've consumed, this one is no exception in having a nicely sized portion, excellent noodles, and being the ONLY product I've ever consumed that had dehydrated vegetables that actually tasted/felt like they were fresh once re-hydrated.What is keeping this from being 4-5 stars is that the Teriyaki sauce is just terrible. I truly cannot imagine how people can say it's ""delicious"". It doesn't even taste like Teriyaki. I'm eating my last bowl of it right now, and I would say the flavor just tastes like terribly seasoned soy sauce.Overall, I would give the noodles/veges/portion size 5 stars, and the sauce 2 stars (generously).",3.0

The packaging needs to be rethought, though.  The peppercorns come in a sealed cellophane bag that isn't really user friendly.  Something self sealing would be preferable.  If you try and tear off a corner on this bag, the cellophane doesn't want to stop tearing when you do.  Scissors are the best way to open and you'll need to find an airtight container to store the rest after filling the grinder.  I'll certainly be purchasing these again.",4.0

6949,"240 Calories and 8 grams of fat per bar, not for calorie counters","I recently spent several months counting calories and monitoring everything I ate in an effort to lose some weight. Never in my life had I ever paid much attention to the actual calorie numbers in foods. I just looked at grams of fat. In the 90's that's what we were all told to do, watch fat grams. Of course now we know better. Calories do indeed matter. I spent a few months using the calorie deficit method (taking in less calories than I was burning daily) and lost about 30 lbs total. I found this worked better for me than going to the gym, since spending every day running on a treadmill just made me eat more! I've been back to eating normal for a few months now, and so far have maintained the weight loss. But I haven't forgotten what I learned during the time I was dieting, and now I check out exactly just how many calories are in the foods I'm eating.Just because something says ""thin"" on the label doesn't mean it's necessarily going to help you reach that goal. After trying this bar, I also read up on the calorie and fat numbers. Each one of these chocolate fudge bars has 240 calories and 8 grams of fat. To give you a comparison, a full size Butterfinger bar has 270 calories and 11 grams of fat. There are actually MORE calories in one of these chocolate fudge bars than in a large Butterfinger bar you can pick up at any gas station in the candy section. What these do have is a bunch of protein. So if you're just doing some basic dieting by cutting calories and trying to shed some pounds, this bar is not going to help you meet any calorie goals. If you're doing intense cardio workouts and need some protein to keep up your stamina, then these are for you. They obviously have some benefit over the empty calories of a candy bar. But for many of the popular diet programs that require you to watch calorie numbers, these bars have the same numbers as a typical candy bar.As for taste, this chocolate fudge is okay. People who only like real chocolate and dislike anything that isn't the real thing, will probably not find the taste all that appealing. For others who are more accepting to the taste of ""diet foods"", the taste/flavor is okay.For those people who prefer the taste of real chocolate, but are looking for something more healthy than candy bars, I'd suggest checking out the KIND PLUS, Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate + Protein, Gluten Free Bars. They have very similar calorie/fat/protein numbers as these thinkThin bars, but use real chocolate that can be loved by even the pickiest candy lovers.",3.0

I'm an animal lover and member of PETA, and I ALWAYS order my pets with overnight shipping.

I also think they need to look up ""whole"" in the dictionary, because as my son pointed out between crying jags, this rabbit is definitely missing some of the more adorable pieces.While I'd normally give this a one star rating for ruining my son's birthday, I'm going to add two stars because it WAS indeed delicious: delicate and nutty in flavor.",3.0

5741,Uninspired,"I'm a big fan of Yogi teas and have purchased literally dozens of varieties. They range from 'good' to 'great'. They are all made with high-quality ingredients. However, Sweet Thai Delight falls on the lower end of the spectrum. It is a decent rooibos tea with a major overtone of coconut. My wife's initial reaction was: ""sun block"". Yes. It tastes like every bottle of sunblock you've ever slathered on at the beach.I do like rooibos, but it does have such a mild, earthy flavor that in this tea, it's easily overwhelmed by the coconut. If you're fond of naturally sweet teas (such as mango, cranberry, etc.) you may like this well enough. But if you are more intrigued by sophisticated floral, herbal, and pure red, green and black teas, you may find this one a little bit daft.I'd also note that this does not brew a cup of Thai tea as you'd get at a restaurant. You may try this with two bags in a standard 12oz mug, but you'll be getting a mouthful of odd-tasting coconut flavor, not rooibos.Not bad at all... but clearly not the best from Yogi.",3.0

7674,Nothing like hot & sour soup - and awful into the bargain.,"Perhaps Annie Chun (and the rest of the manufacturers on the hot & sour bandwagon) understand hot and sour soup to be a completely different animal than I do.  Then again - maybe not.After discovering a love for hot and sour soup at our local Chinese restaurant, I thought I'd try some of the store brands that said ""hot and sour"" on them.  BIG mistake.  The hot and sour soup I am used to is a flavorful, robust soup with chunks of tofu, pork meat, bamboo shoots, egg and dried mushrooms laced throughout it.  It is slightly tangy affair and a bit spicy on the palette.By contrast - oh dear.  Annie Chun has fallen into the same pitfalls the others have when trying to make a store-brand, prepackaged hot and sour soup.  I must admit I was interested when I saw that the noodles were 'fresh' rather than dried - but when you add hot water to them, along with the 'flavor' packet and hot oil sachet.......ugh.  Tastes like someone strained a whole head of garlic and some chillies through a sieve and into a bowl of boiling water.The dried veggies (most noticeably the green onions) are godawful.  They have a consistency more akin to bad calamari, and a taste that more closely resembles cardboard (don't ask how I know what cardboard tastes like).Just awful.  Do yourself a favor - go to your nearest Chinese restaurant, and order like ten servings of hot and sour soup.  It's usually about $3-a-pop, and portion it out into individual freezer-safe tubs or sandwich bags.  Freeze.  Extract one-at-a-time from the freezer when you have the craving.  MUCH HAPPIER!!",1.0

On account of all the water he drinks he has to go pee A LOT and wakes me up in the middle of the night.

That's too bad because I was really excited to give these to my pet since the reviews are really good.

This is a flavored black tea with notes of citrus and vanilla, a bit like panettone cake or King Arthur's ""fiore di sicilia"" flavoring. It's a bit similar to Earl Grey but without that resinous aftertaste and more of a vanilla undertone. Just in the canister, the tea smells perfumed and perhaps overly-flavored, but brewed, the taste of the tea itself becomes more prominent, making a dark, rich, full-bodied brew with an enchantingly subtle flavor profile. It takes a bit of milk handily without turning weak and watery, and re-brews nicely (though re-brews don't take milk as well). It chills well; I prefer it plain when it's cold. It tastes delicious with breakfast and also at any time of the day. Its ability to re-brew makes it more economical a choice, too.As black flavored teas go, this one's a keeper for me.

That seems like an exaggerated claim, and the lack of strings and staples is a real annoyance in my book.  It means I always should use/carry a spoon in order to agitate the bags a bit while steeping, and remove them from the hot tea.  It's so annoying I even considered only 3 stars.  Mostly I drink tea at the office, and bringing a spoon around with me to meetings is odd, so instead I tend to wait until tea is cooler and use my fingers, which also is odd.

That means no hull on the wheat and no fiber... as was intended by nature.  Also it has a lot of sugar and thus high calories.They taste very good, like a dessert.  It is easy to eat two at a time but with so much white flour and sugar they can add weight to you and raise blood sugar levels.I recommend only eating on occasion and as a small treat or dessert in order to curb a sweet tooth.

4309,Not good for those who actually like the taste of ginger...,"Recently, I've been searching for a good ginger tea.  Preferably, something that captures the awesome spiciness and flavor of ginger.  Well, I picked up this tea in a store because it clearly listed ginger as one of the top ingredients and you can even smell the spiciness in the tea bag.  However, once you brew it (and I let it steep a long time) you can't even taste any of the ginger.  What happened to all the spiciness?  I don't know, but it doesn't make a good ginger tea.  Furthermore, it doesn't even taste good otherwise, as it is really bland in flavor.I suppose that there are still some health benefits to drinking this tea, and it would be really good for someone who wants the benefits of ginger but cannot stand its taste.  Personally, though, I was really let down by this tea, hence the 2-star rating.I discovered that you can make tea by directly boiling some slices of fresh ginger root.  This produces a much more satisfying ginger taste and spiciness, and is a whole lot cheaper.  So, if you are searching for spicy ginger tea, just use a fresh root and skip expensive dried teas all together.",2.0

Besides I don't know a whole lot about how Chinese teas are supposed to smell or taste.  I smelled every can and some were okay but most had a strange smell that I would call musty.  I figured the proof was in the tasting.  I made a cup of oolong tea, the one Chinese tea with which I am a little familiar and had to throw it out.  It tasted worse than it smelled.

4329,Wow.,"I got a box for just over a buck on sale to try. I don't have problems going but there are days where I barely do and it's hard so I decided to try this on one of those days. I drank before bed just like the box said, let it sit in boiling water for 15 minutes. Not even an hour after drinking the cramps started. I spent the next hour, maybe longer on the toilet. It was not fun and I was exhausted, I just wanted to sleep. Finally after going more than I ever have in my whole life. I was able to go to bed. Thankfully I did not wake up due to cramping. The next day I felt okay, then I was out shopping and lo and behold the cramps started again. I ended up going back home just to be safe. I went, and went and went throughout the afternoon, wondering when I would ever stop. I didn't stop going until in the evening.So, the reason for the two stars is the cramps. They were bad. Maybe not as bad as some I have had  before. The instructions are not exactly honest, especially how I drank the tea and not even an hour later was going. So clearly it is different for everyone, I will only drink this again if I am so constipated I haven't gone in days, that probably won't happen, but it's there, just in case. The product clearly works but the cramps just aren't worth it too me. Next time I will probably try brewing for only 5 minutes to see if this lessens the side effects. The fact that it cleans you out, is 5 stars.",2.0

8516,Extra Money Same Taste,"Pros:Three times as much fiber as original Mac'n'cheese (3g v 1g / serving)Cons:Costs more than twice as much per serving as original.Bottom Line:Just buy the normal mac and cheese and get your fiber elsewhere.  Nutrition content per serving is nearly identical (as boxed), and as prepared they tell you to use half as much margarine in the vegi mac and cheese vs the normal, so don't compare the ""as prepared"" nutrition content as you can easily cut the butter down with the normal and still retain great taste.  The normal box is 3 servings with 4T butter, this box is 2 servings with 2T butter, so cut the normal down to 3T and you should be fairly similar.Taste wise I notice very little difference between the two, this veggie mac might have a slight vegi aftertaste, but nothing too offensive.  If the price per serving were closer together I would recommend this mac and cheese.  The difference in taste is nothing as strong as whole wheat vs white flour breads.The bottom line is this doesn't really have any significant quantity of vegetables in it, the first ingredient is enriched cauliflower pasta product, but what this means is that it is enriched wheat flour with some dried cauliflower mixed in.",3.0

I increased the amount of tea recommended by doubling then tripling the amount in ratio to the water suggested. I tried varying my water temperature and amount of time boiling. I am still disappointed. Although tripling the amount made for a stronger taste, I still don't notice the lemongrass and vaguely taste the peppermint. I started adding a tea bag of ""Traditional Medicinal Spearmint"" to my batch and that improved the flavor dramatically.Tea has always been in my ""blood"".

As for all the health benefits, the veggies indeed impart ""flavor"" to this mish-mash, a bag of which equals 8 grams of protein plus nearly 600 calories, but what do the veggies contribute and what percentage of the product do they represent?  Unless I notice some dramatic health benefits, I'm going to have trouble disposing of 12 bags (Lesson: Even though Amazon limits you to large quantities, don't order 12 bags if you haven't first tried one).  The only way I can consume this stuff is to wash down every bite with a mouthful of cold Coke.  Or, picking up on the company's pirate theme, Coke laced with a lot of rum.

584,Good value,"I usually dont compare down to this degree for something like this, but since I had it both available, I did a direct side-by-side taste test (subjective) at home with another brand offered by Amazon,Traditional Medicinals Organic Roasted Dandelion Root, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 6). As for the Alvita brand, my senses tell me...Smell: Good! Same nutty aroma that resembles roasted tahini, or peanut brittle.Color: Medium brown, with some reddish tone. Not as dark as Traditional Medicinals.Taste: Good, but not the best I've tasted. Initial flavor like some kind of nutty coffee drink is all there and good, just not as rich. There is also a very slight tang aftertaste.Differences aside, this is a great healthy tea that supposedly promotes healthy liver function. I started drinking this last time I got a caution that my liver enzymes were boderline high. I have yet to confirm that it helped, but the psychological benefits are helping a bit ;). It tastes good, and somewhat resembles hot coffee in the morning, only more healthier.On a comparitive note, the tea bags themselves are cheap. They do not have draw strings like most tea bags have, they are not individually sealed or wrapped, and they come grouped together in a non-resealing package. If this doesn't effect you that much, then I would recommend this buy because you get more tea bags for your money. Otherwise, I think you will get a better experience with Traditional Medicinals. As a final tip, with either brand, the more you steep the more flavor comes out.",4.0

For one thing, that day-glo orange color scares me... and yet that's one of the things he loves best about it. I've tried other mac & cheese products -- and making it from scratch -- but if it's not that vivid orange, he's just not as happy! Two of my other reservations involve the sodium level, and the stuff's ultimate nutritional void.So, enter Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Vegi Original. Using cauliflower in both the pasta and the sauce, Kraft has managed to accomplish the very same thing I'd been doing (sneaking in veggies), so I do feel better about this version. The bright orange color is there, so my son was happy, too. I hadn't told him I was trying anything new, but judging by the way he wolfed down his meal this tastes the exact same. Of course, that still leaves my sodium concern, and with 28% of the daily allowance in a prepared single serving, there's still quite a bit of salt in here.That said, my husband -- who does NOT like mac & cheese OR cauliflower -- also polished off his plate. In 14 years of marriage, I've never seen him do that. So whatever Kraft's up to, it's good and I'm glad not to have to make two separate dinners anymore!To sum up:PROS:1. A good dose of cauliflower in both the pasta and sauce.2. Same easy to follow instructions as the regular stuff.3. No noticeable change in taste or texture, despite the cauliflower addition.4. One less vegetable serving I have to sneak into a meal.5. Same neon orange color as your kids are used to.CONS:1. Still using 'enriched' flour rather than whole grain.2. Still pretty high in sodium (28% daily allowance per serving).3. Still that same neon orange color your kids are used to.",4.0

In general we prefer the Kraft brand to other brands or generic but honestly I sometimes mix in a box of generic or two. Times are tough.We found this one to be very bland. For the amount of sodium, fat, and calories I expected far better. The veggie parts are not significant enough once you hit those fat and calorie levels to justify it. We didn't hate the taste - but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it either. Its probably a bit healthier than regular M&C; but that's not really saying much. Overall - I'd buy it on sale but would not go out of my way otherwise - and if the sale included the regular M&C; I'd buy that instead.

5626,No energy,"I consume energy drinks on a daily basis. For a few years, I drank Rockstar. For the past 2 years I have been making my own with Sodastream - I buy the diet energy because it is no calories and no sugar, but plenty of caffeine. I usually drink a full 1liter bottle first thing in the morning and I must admit I add more syrup than you're supposed to. I use about 1.5 caps of syrup instead of 1 cap. This doesn't make me race around, but just gives me the nudge I need to get on with my day. Sometimes i'll make another half liter later on in the day.This was my first time trying or even hearing of GURU, and unfortunately, I found them to be extremely ineffective. I have drank 6 of them in the past 11 hours (!!) and I took a 2 hour nap during those 11 hrs. I felt no energy at all from them. My last one of the 6 was about a half hour ago. I feel nothing, except a slight stomach ache most likely due to all of the sugar.The taste isn't bad. It has a typical energy drink taste. It has a little less carbonation than a coca cola would. I like a lot of carbonation and that is something else that I am spoiled with, with my sodastream. I can put as much carbonation as I want.I don't mind drinking them as a regular drink, but I won't be going to them specifically for energy. It definitely was not worth all of those calories and all of the sugar.The product info here on the page is a bit misleading. In one place it says 97mg of caffeine per 8.4oz  serving, another place says 100mg, but on the can it says 125mg.My sodastream claims 80mg caffeine per 8oz serving. Maybe the &#34;natural&#34; caffeine in GURU is not as potent?The sodastream syrup also has some vitamin content -  20% daily value of Vitamins B6 and B12, Niacin, Folate, Riboflavin, and Biotin, as well as 50% daily value of Vitamin C. It may not mean much, but I like having that vitamin content, as I am a picky/poor eater and I need to consume them wherever I can.The can says not to mix with alcohol and I am wondering why.I wouldn't recommend these to someone who drinks energy drinks regularly and has a tolerance for caffeine because they are ineffective.",1.0

I know the manufacturer says most babies who start on this stay on it for nine months.  My daughter did not.  Her pediatrician didn't feel she needed it once she hit about 8 lbs.

In the middle of a bite of fruitcake, there is a rather hard, chewy almond to deal with.  Not pleasant.  And there were a lot of almonds.  The ironic thing is that this fruitcake is made in Georgia and I believe Georgia grows pecans, my favorite.  Next, I found the cake to be rather dry compared to other fruitcakes.

4069,Not very cheese flavored,"Well, I guessed that a product marketed as being ""three-cheese"" flavored would taste reasonably cheese-like.  If I'd been given this in a blind taste-test, I'm unsure I would have even identified it as supposing to be a cheese-flavored product.  It's really, really bland.There's nothing inherently wrong with ""bland"" if that's what you are after.  Bland obviously is want one wants for a base for other things, for example.  But the marketing on this product seems deceptive to me.  It is sold as a ""meal in a bowl"" (suggesting it's not just a base, but a fully seasoned dish).  I specifically ordered it because I was looking for a quick way to make some basic cheesy pasta, and the product (and reviews) suggest that this is meant to be a cheese flavored item.  If it was marketed as ""pasta in a mild, light sauce with a hint of cheese flavor"", then I wouldn't have ordered it, because that wasn't what I was looking for.  I can see that someone might be looking for something like that; but in any event, that's not the implication from the packaging.I don't like dissing this product because it sounds like a number of people find it convenient, like the flavor, and want to be able to keep ordering it.  So I would say, as long as you understand that this a very gently flavored item, of predictably low quality pasta, and that will suit your purposes, great.  I appreciate honest reviews that others leave of their opinions, since it helps me figure out what I might like that I haven't tried yet.  We all have different tastes and needs for products, so I hope this review helps those who were thinking along the lines that I was when ordering this.",3.0

3121,"Very grassy taste out of the bottle; better to use for dressing, marinade, or for cooking","Let me start of by saying I really really wanted to like this olive oil. Organic, naturally processed, from California, great price, awesome reviews. I was hoping I'd find a full bodied balanced tasty olive oil to take the place of my expensive olive oils from Spain. Please note, I am a sommelier and have a pretty refined palate. Just like with my wines I look for balance. I don't mind acidity, I don't mind bitterness, I don't mind a bit of fresh herbaceous taste. Balance for me is key. I like my olive oil to be  rich, nutty, and full of balanced flavor. Fruity, buttery, earthy, peppery are all good ...again they need to be in balance.This oil is way too overtop green and grassy tasting. If you like the taste of wheat grass juice then this will be up your alley. I pored an ounce in a dish and just dipped my bread in it. Full bodied, very grassy, good acidity, with a long somewhat bitter finish. Maybe made into a dressing you can hide some of these overpowering unbalanced favors. Who knows these flavors might even signify a healthier olive oil with more antioxidants? I'll pass. I am returning the olive oil and sticking to what I know I like.Update: I hate wasting food and the thought of  returning the Item did not sit right because I knew the item would just be thrown in the trash. So I tried to see if I can use the item for cooking and not straight out of the bottle. Tonight I grabbed four medium tomatoes from my veggie garden, two cloves of garlic, 1.5 ounces of the olive oil, salt and pepper. I heated the oil in a skillet, sliced the tomatoes and added them to the hot oil, added the crushed garlic cloves, salt, and pepper. Cooked over the stove top for 3-4 minutes at high heat while occasionally stirring. I then added a few eggs to the mixture , put the lid on the skillet, and let the eggs poach in this thick tomato sauce for 5 minutes. Finally I added an ounce of crumbled feta cheese at the end. Had this for dinner with some Ezekiel bread tonight. Very yummy! The olive oil's over the top grassy flavors were masked by all the other ingredients. So I decided to keep the oil to use in my recipes and not as my go to dipping oil.",3.0

I tolerate the licorice flavor in the CALM Yogi tea because it really calms me before bed and makes me feel like I am floating on a cloud, but it still manages to taste good whereas this one does not.Please do buy Yogi tea and get the Green Tea Slim Life instead- terrific taste, which tastes like green tea with berries in it- a good flavor and not an artificial flavor to it.

Perhaps it is the addition of stevia leaf that gives it that strange taste. I never liked the taste of stevia, and it is one of the main ingredients in this tea, in 5th place, ahead of the ginger, clove and black pepper! I also don't like to see so many added flavors in it.

6126,A little bit different from most.,"Anyone who loves mac-n-cheese has tried some type of brand of shells-n-cheese. The only difference is the shape of the pasta. It became a huge hit with kids because it is so cheesy.Then various companies decided to use real cheese spreads, usually with some sort of plastic or foil pouch encloused. These caught on quickly for good reason. Not only can consumers see that they are getting, in most cases, real cheese, but consumers feel that they are making the dish healther for the family.Whether that is true or not depends mainly on WHICH brand you used. The more expensive the brand does not always mean more healthy. Let us face it, many powders are just as good tasting and as healthy for your family as the squeeze. It was psychological. It worked.Then came microwave mac-n-cheese. This quickly became a busy parent's dream. However, it is not much faster than stove top. (Perhaps 4 minutes.) But when people think of microwaves, they think ""fast"". So this is currently the new craze. Not much faster and still bowls to wash. You usually get LESS pasta this way too, even though you are paying just a little bit more than normal for what you think is convenient.KRAFT advertises more than most brands, so shoppers are more apt to pick up the KRAFT brand. Think about it. How many ads do you recall seeing about ANNIE'S HOMEGROWN? Personally, I do not recall a single one. Therefore, most people totally ignore this brand.Bad move. If you check out the box, this brand is actually better for you, yes, more healthy for you, than KRAFT. Cost is about the same as well.But this comes with a little twist, ANNIE'S HOMEGROWN encloses WHITE cheddar, for a slightly different taste. Yes, there are a few other white cheddar brands out there, but again, check the box. This one really is healthier for you.So before you pick up the store generic or any other brand, you might want to take just a little time to read the package.

5762,It worked for me anyway,"I am one of those people who when they get a bad cold it eventually settles into the chest in a very bad way (family genes) and each time it takes longer and longer to really lose the cough and congestion. Last weekend the latest cold making the rounds hit me and head sorely congested I spotted this on the grocery shelves and decided to give it a shot. While it isn't the greatest tasting tea ever, my head did clear up enough so that I passed on the cold medicine for the night, and the cold had pretty much cleared up the next morning, and virtually no chest congestion at all.",5.0
750,Exellent,This is an excellent product. The honey is smooth and tasty and if there is a drawback it is that the honey is solid - not crystallized but more like smooth butter.

7283,"pizza and bread are okay, DO NOT make the pie crust recipe","This would have gotten 4 or 5 stars if the manufacturer hadn't caused me major frustration today with one of the recipes on the bag.The bread made from this mix is okay, not REAL bread but close as one can get without wheat.Pizza crust was fine too.I used it to make pie crust, following the recipe on the bag.  What a disaster.  IMPOSSIBLE to get the pie dough transferred to the pan, kept falling apart.  No way I could get the top crust on in one piece.  I ended up cutting strips.  Tastes okay but very frustrating to make.Also, the recipe is for a tart crust, not a pie crust as that it insists you use butter.  Makes the crust REALLY rich, even substituting half shortening as the allows.",3.0
2375,Coca-Cola's Goodness (3.5 stars),"No I didn't give this 4 or 5 stars. I have a few legatimate beefs with Coca-Cola. I like supporting Atlanta based companies (has anyone been to the world of Coca Cola here? Check it out), and Coca Cola and their products are one of my favorites. It's addactive and with the caffeine will keep you up for a couple of hours. Also it has it's refreshing taste, that makes me want to pop open another one. Thats where the innovation stops here.For about 20 years, I've drank this product. As time went along, this product has gone through some changes, mostly to compete with their infamous rival Pepsi (as well as other companies). For a while I had a rebellion against this soda because of them making changes in their taste to match other companies. I guess thats a marketing technique or something, because the goal is to sell more products, and have a higher turnover rate. And for about 3 years, I wouldn't drink this soda. Just about the start of this year I decided to give Coca Cola Classic another try, and thinking they are going back to the older formula (trust me, you can notice the difference). Coca Cola is on the rise once again, and I hope that it will be back on top with their products in the soda industry. For right now I have a good wait ahead of me because of my high expectations from them.Don't get me wrong, I've always liked their products, especially Cherry Coke and Sprite, as well as the original Coca Cola Classic. I just believe that it shouldn't try TOO hard in competion, because that can seriously backfire.Chandler Infamous, and I'm ghost. Peace!",3.0

2459,"After branching out and trying other brands, it's clear that Tabasco is overrated and low-quality.  Not a good sauce.","I used to be a Tabasco fan.  I really did.But after branching out and trying other sauces, I can't help but see how flawed it is.  And I think its popularity is due not to its quality, but due to it being a recognizable brand.The quality shockingly isn't as high as you might think.  In fact, I find it to be quite low-quality.  After sampling many other sauces in the past few months (I'm going through a hot-sauce kick lately), Tabasco in retrospect comes off as quite cheap-tasting and with no real flavor.  And the burn isn't natural.  It tastes ""chemically.""  Mainly due to the fact that all you taste is vinegar.  And to me, that's not the mark of a good sauce.  A good sauce should have a natural burn (moreso like fire or radiating heat) and a nice flavor to it.  It shouldn't taste too vinegary and it definitely shouldn't have an artificial-feeling ""chemically"" burn.  But that's what Tabasco really tastes like when I really pay attention and analyze it.Just to make my analysis more fair and up-to-date, tonight I decided to do a taste-test with it and some of the others sauces I had on hand.  I used about six different sauces in comparable amounts.  Straight to the tongue.  (With a ""cool down"" period in between so I could clear my mouth out of the burn and flavor)  And classic Tabasco was the worst in terms of flavor.  I hate to say that, because I know its popular due to its recognizable nature.  But it was the worst by far.  To the point I almost just tossed the whole bottle in the trash, because I don't see myself using it ever.  I didn't, since I figured I should have it on-hand for friends who may want some.  But I definitely won't be using it again.I'm quite saddened by how poorly classic Tabasco holds up.  But don't get me wrong.  I do like some of their other available flavors a little bit.  (I think their Chipotle sauce is ok, because it at least has a slight touch of flavor, though again, it's far too ""vinegary"" for its own good.)  But classic Tabasco is just very poor in retrospect.Low quality.  No real flavor.  Gross ""chemically"" burn.  I'd say branch out and try something new instead of going with the same-old Tabasco.",1.0
4338,Dr. said not to drink,"Years ago I wrote a review singing the praises of Smooth Move, which I'd drunk for years. But two different doctors told me it probably wasn't a good idea to drink it. One reason is that it stains your colon. So when you have a colonoscopy, it's more difficult for the doctor to see what's going on in there. Also, it's a stimulant laxative, which can cause problems with regular use. I now take Miralax, which works perfectly, and the doctor says I can take as much of that as I want.",1.0
810,Possible dangerous / deadly toxic reactions to product if used in quantities greater than .5% of total food or liquid volume,"This Thanksgiving I went to my sisters, she made gravy with Zanthan Gum.  Shortly after sampling the gravy I had a severe toxic reaction; my face looked like a puffer fish, my heart was racing, vertigo, my tongue started to swell,  I developed sepsis and my lungs partially collapsed.The packaging does not provide any guidance or black box warning (as it should!) about the severe toxicity if used in quantities greater than .5% of total volume of food or liquid.  The manufacturer is negligent and even deceptive in marketing this manufactured product as if it were all natural.Xanthan gum is a largely indigestible polysaccharide that is produced by bacteria called Xanthomonas Camestris.  Manufacturers place the bacteria in a growth medium that contains sugars and other nutrients, and the resulting product of bacterial fermentation is purified, dried, powdered, and sold as xanthan gum. (Makes you wonder who first thought to put it in food, doesn't it?)In other words, xanthan gum is an industrial processed product--  It is a polysaccharide produced by a biotechnological fermentation process--a chemical. There is nothing natural about xanthan gum.Certainly never mix or serve to small children until the dangers are fully explained by the FDA's ongoing investigations. Currently, there are on-going lawsuits as a result of Xanthan Gum being added to baby formula to thicken it, the babies intestines developed holes and collapsed, resulting in deaths.FDA has issued new cautions and studies as to this food additive's safety. It certainly should not be sold in bulk giving the appearance that it is a flour of some type very misleading and possibly deadly.  We'll likely all hear more soon on this issue - just be cautious and know what and how much you are putting into your food and body - or your family's.One lesser-known use of xanthan gum is in the oil industry. As a thickener, it can be added to drilling fluid or drilling mud to improve its function. Drilling fluid serves several purposes, including cooling the drill bit, providing hydrostatic pressure, and helping to lift solids out of the borehole and keeping those solids in suspension when drilling stops.Gluten-free is not the same food just without Gluten, something else is added in it's place.  FInd out what and how safe it it is - better yet, just avoid any foods with Gluten if you do have Celiac's disease.  Shortcuts are rarely quite as simple as them may seem in my experience.",1.0

7144,Faux-Cinnamon Bun Cookie Does Not Satisfy as a Replacement for the Real Thing,"It's just a cookie...and quite a fattening one at that.  One 1.76-ounce pouch of Cinnamania Cinnamon Buns comes in at a whopping 230 calories with a significant 30% from fat. The contents consist of several small graham cracker-type cookies with a white sugar glaze to simulate rather half-heartedly the look of a cinnamon bun. The consistency, however, perhaps due to the enriched wheat flour, is anything but and a pale imitation of what you would buy at a Starbucks or bake from a Pillsbury roll-up package.In fact, the weakly-named Cinnamania is more akin to something from Mother's Cookies, the kind of unmemorable confection you would find in one of those big bags you get at discount on Costco. The flavor is not bad, just undistinguished considering how it has been positioned as a proxy for a freshly-baked bun. The package exclaims that it's a ""Good Source of Calcium and 4 Vitamins"", but it hardly warrants an endorsement for its questionable nutritional value. If you have a need for a cinnamon bun, then I suggest you go to your nearest Cinnabon in order to justify the calorie intake.",2.0

It sits well on the stomach, even an empty one. It provides and fairly quick ramp up in energy and alertness and lasts for several hours to all day. The ramp down in gently and hardly noticeable.

4894,Pretty Good.,"This clam chowder is very creamy and tasty. One thing that some people may not like is the fact that unlike all of Campbell's other New England clam chowder's, the Soup at Hand clam chowder has NO chunks of anything what so ever. I am not exaggerating when I say that there is nothing much bigger than a grain of rice in this soup. At first I didn't like the texture of the chowder, but now I kind of like it because all the tiny bits in it makes the seem a bit thicker. If you like big chunks of potato and clams you will not find it here.I believe that the other reviewer that talked about the chunks of potato etc. probably has tried Campbell's other microwavable Clam chowder which does indeed have big chunks, but I don't think that reviewer has eaten the Soup at Hand version of the chowder.",3.0

Here's how....Zico used to be real 100% coconut water. Now, after conglomerate Coca Cola bought them, it's dumbed down: it's now part coconut water (juice) watered down with H2O (water) with unspecified ""natural flavor"" added so you are tricked into thinking your coconut water hasn't just been seriously diluted. Why?  It's cheaper!  They save money by cutting it with plain water.  But it wouldn't taste the same, right?  That's where the flavoring comes in.... To trick you.Zico wont actually specify how much they water it down but you can guesstimate simply by their ads.... They brag this product has 30% less sugar than other brands.  Ok, that means this is likely a 70% coconut to 30% water mixture.  Do you want 100% coconut water or 70% coconut water in your bottle?This isn't the ratio nature intended by the way.
