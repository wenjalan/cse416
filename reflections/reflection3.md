# Learning Reflection 3
## Summary
This week introduces classification, the next major chapter in Machine Learning. Classification tasks are ones that take some numerical input and output discrete categories. Our example will be sentiment classification of restaurant reviews.

## Concepts
### Classification
A machine learning task concerned with categorizing an input as one or more discrete classes of labels.

### Linear Classification
Using a linear input (such as number of a certain word) to a classification model, and outputting a predicted label.

### Probability
Instead of predicting a label 1 or -1, we can predict the likelihood of an input representing a given output.

### Likelihood
The probability that a given input is representing an output, which can be used to perform gradient ascent.

## Uncertainties
How does classification work with non-binary output spaces?
