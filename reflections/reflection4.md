# Learning Reflection 3
## Summary
This week introduces Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Ensemble Methods.

## Concepts
### Naive Bayes
A classification model that classifies inputs as to how likely they are to appear as each label.

### Decision Trees
A classification model that use a series of decisions about data to split data among categories.

### Ensemble Methods
Ensemble methods are methods that use multiple types of models together to create a better performing one.

### Bagging
Bagging is the use of multiple models, and using the majority class classifier to determine final output.

### Boosting
Boosting is the use of multiple low-accuracy models, and using their weighted outputs to determien a final output. 

## Uncertainties
Can bagging and boosting be used with different types of models, other than trees?
